      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the introductory
      chapter of &ldquo;The History of the People of the United States,&rdquo; Mr. McMaster
      announces as his subject, &ldquo;The history of the people from the close of the
      war for Independence down to the opening of the war between the States.&rdquo;
       It seems at first thought improbable that a history excluding both the
      Revolution and the Civil War should prove in any great degree interesting,
      but the first twelve pages suffice to convince one to the contrary. With
      consummate skill in selection and narration, Mr. McMaster has brought to
      light information of a singularly novel character. Impressed with this
      unlooked-for quality, it occurred to me that here was ground that had not
      been previously gone over&mdash;not, at any rate, in a story for children.
      &ldquo;A Loyal Little Red-Coat&rdquo; has been the outcome. Whether I have succeeded
      in transferring to these pages aught of the peculiar interest of the
      history remains to be seen. This much may be said, however, that every
      historical allusion is based upon actual fact. The English Circus, the
      Captain's letter, Harry's Prison-Ship experiences, Alexander Hamilton's
      successful defence of a Tory client, the treatment of the Bonifaces at the
      ball&mdash;all find their counterpart in the realities of a century ago.
      For much of the minor historical detail I am indebted to those rare and
      quaint old volumes, carefully treasured by our historical societies, which
      make possible the faithful recounting of the story of bygone days. In my
      attempt to reproduce the child-life of a time so far removed, I have
      probably been guilty of some anachronisms. If, however, I have woven a
      page of history into a story that, by any chance, shall interest the
      children, for whom it has been a delight to me to write it, I shall be
      sincerely grateful.

    <p>
      AZEL BONIFACE was a Loyalist, which means that she was a hearty little
      champion of King George the Third of England, and this notwithstanding she
      lived in America, and was born there. It had happened to be on a crisp
      October morning of the year 1773 that Hazel's gray eyes first saw the
      light, and they no sooner saw the light than they saw a wonderful red
      coat, and just as soon as she was able to understand it, she learned that
      that red coat belonged to her papa, and that her papa belonged to King
      George's army. So, after all, you see it was but natural that she should
      have been a little Loyalist from the start, and quite to have been
      expected that she should, grow more and more staunch with every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it chanced one midwinter afternoon, when Hazel was about six years
      old, that she came into the city&mdash;that is, into New York&mdash;on an
      errand with her father, and that she stood for a while watching a merry
      party of boys, who were having the jolliest sort of a time coasting down
      Powder House Hill, and skating on the clear, crystal ice of the Collect.
      The Collect and Powder House Hill! You never heard of them, did you, and
      yet may have lived in New York all your life; but you may believe the
      little New Yorkers of those days knew them and loved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Collect (though where it got its name no one knows) was a beautiful
      sheet of water connected with the North River by a creek crossing
      Broadway, where we now have Canal street, and the hill where the Powder
      House stood was one of the pretty heights that bordered it. Wouldn't some
      of the little people who live in that crowded part of the city to-day be
      surprised to know, that only a hundred years ago ponds and hills took the
      place of the level city streets, and that a boy could start way over east
      of Broadway, skate under the arch at Canal street, and then strike out
      across the broad Lispenard meadows straight to the North River? But those
      boys of the olden time, who were spending their short afternoon holiday
      there on the ice, were exactly like the boys of to-day, in that they were
      cutting up the very silliest sort of capers. Hazel, however, thought it
      all very funny, and longing for the time when she should have a pair of
      skates of her own, wondered if that boy with the pretty name&mdash;that
      boy the other boys called Starlight&mdash;would teach her how to use them.
      And so one time when he came gliding her way she called out, quite to the
      surprise of her father, whose hand she stood holding, &ldquo;Will you teach me
      how to skate when I grow old enough, Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, yes,&rdquo; came the answer, as soon as the finest little
      skater that ever buckled skates on the Collect could put the brakes to his
      winged feet, &ldquo;but you must tell me your name, so that I shall know you
      when you grow up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hazel, Hazel Boniface,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;and is your name really Starlight?
      It's a beautiful name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Starlight's my last name; my other name is Job; that isn't so
      pretty, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not; I shall always call you just Starlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Hazel had been true to her word, and had always called Job just
      Starlight, and Job had been true to his promise, and had long ago taught
      Hazel to skate, for she was ten now and he fourteen, and they had been the
      best of friends this long while, notwithstanding Job was as zealous a Whig
      as was Hazel a Loyalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, for fear you should not happen to know just what is meant by Whig
      and Loyalist, you must&mdash;there is no help for it if you are to
      understand this story&mdash;put up with a solid little bit of history
      right here and now. You see Hazel was born in 1773, and as she has just
      scored a tenth birthday, that brings us to 1783, and 1783 found affairs in
      New York in a decidedly topsy-turvy state. A great war had been going on
      for eight long years called, as you know, the war of the Revolution,
      because the colonies in America had <i>revolted</i>, declaring their
      determination to be independent, and that King George of England should no
      longer be their king. And all that while, that is, during those eight long
      years, King George's soldiers had been in possession of New York, and many
      of the Whigs&mdash;and Whigs, remember, are the people who sided against
      King George&mdash;had fled from their dwellings, and scores of Loyalists,
      pouring into the city to be under the protection of the English soldiers,
      had made their homes in the Whigs' empty houses. But now matters were
      beginning to look very differently. The great war was over, the colonies
      had been successful, and although the English soldiers were still in New
      York, they were soon to go, every one of them, and the Whigs were
      returning in great numbers, and trying to turn out the Loyalists, whom
      they found living in their homes. Most of these Loyalists, however, were
      very loath to go, some of them, indeed, avowing that go they would not! No
      wonder, then, that affairs in New York in 1783 were in a decidedly
      topsy-turvy state; and this brings us to the real commencement of our
      story, and to Hazel, sitting alone on the porch of her home at Kings
      Bridge, and with a most woe-begone expression on her usually happy face.
      Suddenly a new thought seemed to strike her, and she started on a brisk
      little run for the gate; but it was simply that, hearing the sound of
      wheels in the distance, she knew that the Albany coach was coming, and the
      Albany coach was what she was waiting for. That was long before the days
      of railroads, and when all the travelling must needs be done in that
      &ldquo;slow-coach&rdquo; fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Albany stage was generally full inside, and, as Hazel expected, this
      morning was no exception; but that did not make the least difference in
      the world to her, for what she wanted was a seat beside Joe Ainsworth, the
      driver. Indeed, it was not an unusual thing for Hazel to ask for a ride
      into town, nor for Joe to grant it, so that the moment he spied her
      standing in the road ahead of him, he knew what it meant, and reined up
      his four dusty white horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel looked very sweet and fresh, no doubt, in the eyes of the wearied
      travellers, who had journeyed all night in the jouncing stage, and, in
      fact, she would have looked sweet and fresh in the eyes of anybody whose
      eyes were good for very much. She wore a quaint little gown and kerchief,
      as yet without rumple or wrinkle, for it was but nine o'clock in the
      morning, and breakfast and a quiet little &ldquo;think&rdquo; on the porch had not
      proved in the least damaging to either skirt or kerchief. To tell the
      truth, Hazel had an intense regard for a fresh and dainty toilet, and
      somehow contrived to scale the side of the coach without in any way
      begriming her pretty dress, although she was obliged to make use of one
      great dusty wheel in ascending. First she planted both feet on its hub,
      and then by aid of Joe's hand fairly bounded to her seat beside him with
      quite as much grace as a little deer of the forest, and a &ldquo;little dear&rdquo;
       she was in point of fact, if you alter but one letter in the spelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; said Joe, after he had started up his horses, &ldquo;how are
      you this warm morning?&rdquo; for it was early September, and the sun was
      already shining hotly down upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm very well then,&rdquo; after a moment's pause, &ldquo;No, I don't believe I
      am very well, either, because, Joe, I feel very blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe; &ldquo;you blue! Why, you ought not to learn even the
      meaning of the word these twenty years yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some children learn it very young, Joe,&rdquo; with a real little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what in creation have you to be blue about, I'd like to know? Perhaps
      you have gotten a spot on that pretty Sunday frock of yours,&rdquo; for Joe knew
      Hazel's little weakness in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; said Hazel, indignantly, and with such a world of reproof in her
      tone that Joe had to pretend to cough to keep from laughing. &ldquo;If you think
      a moment, Joe, I'm sure you will remember that I have reason to feel very,
      very blue indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel was so serious that Joe felt in duty bound to put his thinking-cap
      on, and ransacked his brain for the possible occasion of her depression.
      Hazel, with childish dignity, did not offer to help him in the matter, and
      they drove for a few moments in a silence broken only by the creak of the
      weather-beaten stage, and the regular, monotonous rattle of the
      loose-fitting harness. Down through the dusty yellow leaves of the
      roadside trees the sunlight filtered, to the dustier hedges below, and
      there was little or no life in the air. Indeed, it was a morning when one
      had need to be very much preoccupied <i>not</i> to feel blue, as Hazel
      called it, and a discriminating person might have deemed the weather in a
      measure responsible for her down-heartedness. Meanwhile the horses jogged
      along at the merest little pretence of a trot, and, missing the customary,
      &ldquo;Get-up, Jenny!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whist there, Kate!&rdquo; subsided into a walk, varied
      more than once by a deliberate standstill, whenever the &ldquo;off-leader&rdquo; saw
      fit to dislodge a persistent fly by the aid of a hind hoof. &ldquo;Look here,
      driver!&rdquo; called one of the passengers at last, &ldquo;there's a snail on the
      fence there, that will beat us into town if you don't look out.&rdquo; The fact
      was, Joe had not only put his thinking-cap on, but had pulled it so far
      down over his ears, that he had quite forgotten all about his horses and
      Hazel, and his thoughts had gone &ldquo;wool-gathering,&rdquo; as old people's
      thoughts have a fashion of going. &ldquo;Get along with you,&rdquo; he called to the
      tired team, thoroughly roused from his reveries, and spurring them into
      greater activity with his long whip-lash; then, turning to Hazel, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Come
      to think of it, I should not wonder if you are blue about that little
      Starlight matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Starlight matter! Do you think it's a little matter, Mr.
      Ainsworth, to be kept out of your house and have a lot of soldiers living
      in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are King George's soldiers; that ought to make it all right in
      your eyes, Miss Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the men are not to blame; they have to do as the officers tell them;
      but I hate that old Captain Wadsworth. Sometimes I think I'll write and
      tell King George what a dreadful man he is, for I don't believe he knows.
      But, after all, they say it's an American, our own Colonel Hamilton,
      that's most to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexander Hamilton! Why, how's that?&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, knowing well enough,
      but wishing to hear Hazel grow eloquent on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is how it is, Mr. Ainsworth,&rdquo; and Hazel folded her hands and
      composed herself for what promised to be quite a long story. &ldquo;You know the
      Starlights. Well, they've lived right on that same piece of land ever
      since Job's great-great-grandfather, who was an Englishman, married a
      Dutch wife and came to live in New York. Why, there weren't more than
      half-a-dozen houses here when they came, and if anybody has a right to
      their land and their house, they have. They used to be a very big family,
      the Starlights did, but now there's only Job left and his Aunt Frances.
      She's the loveliest lady, Joe, and so very fond of Starlight (that's Job),
      and Starlight is just as good to her as a boy can be. Well, one night,
      nearly two years ago, a party of English soldiers (some of them were awful
      bad fellows, Joe, even if they were the King's men) went about the street
      doing just about as they pleased, and Miss Avery&mdash;that is, Aunt
      Frances&mdash;was very much frightened, as well she might be, and the next
      day she packed up and took the ferry to Paulus Hook, to stay with some
      friends of hers, who live over there and own a big farm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Van Vleets, don't you?&rdquo; questioned Joe, now wisely dividing
      his attention between Hazel's narrative and his horses, who were only too
      quick to detect any lack of vigilance on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do you know them, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know 'em like a book, Miss Hazel. Old Jacob Van Vleet has been over the
      road with me scores of times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they're very kind people, Joe, and Starlight and his aunt are
      living there still, only now that the war is over they want to come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's not an easy thing to do, is it,&rdquo; laughed Joe, &ldquo;when your house
      is full of English officers and their men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the soldiers have no right there, Joe, and the worst of it is,
      Captain Wadsworth says he is going to resign his commission and stay after
      his men go back to England, and make it his own home. He says it belongs
      to him. It was given to him, after Miss Avery left it, by what they call a
      military order. But, military order or no, Joe, that house belongs to Aunt
      Frances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it would seem so, Miss Hazel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it hadn't been for Colonel Alexander Hamilton she'd be in it
      to-day, Joe. You see she went to law about it, and they say Colonel
      Hamilton, who took Captain Wadsworth's side, is so smart and so handsome
      that he just talked the court into deciding against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly was mighty queer in Lawyer Hamilton,&rdquo; said Joe,
      meditatively, &ldquo;to turn against his own side in that fashion; but, Miss
      Hazel, why don't you go and see him about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel looked up a moment with a questioning gaze to see if he Were quite
      in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I am going to do this very day,&rdquo; she answered,
      reassured, &ldquo;and first I want to see Captain Wadsworth. Let me down at the
      Starlights' gate, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So a few moments later the Albany coach reined up in front of the
      Starlight homestead, and Hazel, jumping quickly down from the coach with a
      &ldquo;Thank you for the ride, Joe,&rdquo; swung open the old Dutch gate with an air
      well calculated to make the heart of Captain Wadsworth quake.

    <p>
      ORE than one pair of ears heard the creak of the clumsy Dutch gate as it
      swung on its hinges for Hazel, for every door and window of Captain
      Wadsworth's quarters stood wide open to catch all there was of any little
      cooling breeze which might bestir itself that close September morning. And
      more than one pair of eyes glancing in the same direction saw Hazel coming
      up the path and brightened at the sight of her. They knew her well, all
      those English soldiers, for she had often accompanied her father when he
      had come among them on business, and while he was busy here and there, had
      chattered in her frank, fearless way with one and another. Indeed, owing
      to her loyalist principles and a little red coat which she was in the
      habit of wearing, she was familiarly known among the rank and file of his
      Majesty's service as &ldquo;Little Red-Coat,&rdquo; and often addressed by that name.
      But this was her first visit all by herself, and, to tell the truth, Hazel
      had some misgiving as to its propriety, and as to her own behavior in
      running off in this fashion, for she had announced her departure to no
      one. Her sister Josephine, however, had happened to see her taking her
      seat on the Albany stage, and wondered what she was up to. But &ldquo;runaway&rdquo;
       or no, the eyes that saw Hazel Boniface did nevertheless brighten at the
      sight of her, from those of Captain Wadsworth's old body-servant, who was
      brushing the Captain's clothes very vigorously from one of the
      dormer-windows in the steep sloping roof, to those of the Captain himself,
      who sat tipped back in a great arm-chair in a corner of the wide piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Hazel,&rdquo; said the Captain, rising to meet her. &ldquo;Have you
      come on some errand for your papa, or simply to pay us a nice little visit
      and cheer us up a bit? English soldiers need cheering nowadays, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Hazel, sympathetically; for, true to her Loyalist
      sentiments, she felt sorry enough that these same English soldiers had not
      been successful in the war they had been waging; but her mind was intent
      at present on her own private business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come just to make you a little visit, Captain Wadsworth,&rdquo; she
      continued, &ldquo;and to talk to you a little, and I don't believe I can cheer
      you up at all, because I am pretty blue myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The corners of Captain Wadsworth's mouth twitched at the thought of such a
      fair and youthful little specimen indulging in the blues; but he succeeded
      in asking gravely, as he led the way indoors, &ldquo;Why, how ever can that be?
      Come right into the office here and tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't the office at all,&rdquo; she said, emphatically, as she took her
      seat on a little Dutch rocker that had been Aunt Frances's sewing-chair.
      &ldquo;This is the sitting-room, and it's dreadful, Captain Wadsworth, to see it
      so dusty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Wadsworth looked decidedly puzzled and astonished for a moment,
      then he added, slowly, &ldquo;Oh, I see! I suppose you knew the people who used
      to own this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and I know them now; they're the very best friends I have; and,
      if you please, this house belongs to them still, and they would like to
      come back just as soon as you can move your men out, and,&rdquo; noting a few
      unfamiliar objects in the room, &ldquo;your furniture and other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that this was rather a bold speech for a little maid
      to venture quite upon her own authority, but Hazel had made this visit for
      no other reason than plainly to speak her mind, and speak it she would,
      though she did have to screw her courage up to the very highest pitch in
      order to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> mean to say, Miss Hazel, that you think we have no right
      here?&rdquo; questioned the Captain..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Hazel answered warmly, feeling, somehow, that Captain
      Wadsworth was open to conviction. &ldquo;You see you really have no right here
      at all, and I thought that as soon as you understood that you would not
      stay another minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the trouble is, I don't understand it; the law says it belongs to me,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess the law does not tell the truth, Captain Wadsworth, because
      even the law cannot make a thing so that isn't so, can it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, certainly not, and it isn't supposed to even try to do that sort
      of thing, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's just what it does exactly,&rdquo; said Hazel, and in her eagerness
      she deserted the little rocker and came and leaned on the desk near to the
      Captain. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said, confidentially, &ldquo;I'm just as true to King
      George as true can be, and I am awful sorry his soldiers have been beaten,
      and I don't think a country without a King is any good at all. Sometimes
      I'm almost ashamed that I was born here; but still, some very nice people,
      like Miss Avery and Starlight, do not think just as I do, and I think
      their rights ought to be respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were pretty big words, and the Captain looked as though he thought
      so; but even a very little woman, when she is very much in earnest,
      sometimes finds language at her command quite as astonishing to herself as
      to her hearers. &ldquo;Rights ought to be respected&rdquo;&mdash;certainly that did
      sound remarkable. Hazel herself wondered where she had picked up so fine
      an expression, and one that suited so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Starlight?&rdquo; asked the Captain, willing to digress a little from
      the main point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The owner of this house,&rdquo; said Hazel, not willing to digress at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought it used to belong to Miss Avery; the property certainly
      stood in her name.&rdquo; The Captain was careful to use only the past tense.
      According to his way of thinking, that Starlight homestead was just as
      rightfully his as though he had bought and paid for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Hazel said, &ldquo;Good-by, Captain,&rdquo; and the Captain bowed her out of
      his office as gallantly as though she had been a little princess. Four or
      five of the men had gathered on the porch outside, thinking to have a chat
      with her when she should have finished her errand with the Captain, but
      Hazel, absorbed in her own thoughts, was about to pass them by without so
      much as a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Miss Hazel, aren't you going to speak to a fellow?&rdquo; one of the
      men called after her. &ldquo;Yes, of course I am,&rdquo; Hazel replied, as though that
      had been her full intention, and, going back, held out her hand to
      Sergeant Bellows, the man who had called to her, and then, as it seemed to
      be expected of her, shook hands in a friendly way with the other men, all
      of whom she knew by name. But it was easy enough for the dullest among
      them to discover that her greeting lacked all its wonted cheeriness.
      Indeed, Hazel had not yet learned the need of disguising her real
      feelings, and always &ldquo;carried her heart on her sleeve,&rdquo; as the saying
      goes, so that you were at perfect liberty to share all its sentiments,
      whether of joy or sorrow. So it was not strange that for the third time
      she was questioned as to the reason for her evident depression. &ldquo;Feeling a
      little down this morning, eh?&rdquo; asked Sergeant Bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel nodded her head in assent. &ldquo;There's nothing an old sergeant could do
      for you, is there, Miss Hazel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a corporal?&rdquo; asked one of the other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a high private?&rdquo; asked another. Hazel took their offers of assistance
      in perfect good faith, and would not have hesitated to call upon any or
      all of them, but she really did not see how they could be of any use to
      her, and shook her head hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not. The only man who can help me now is Colonel Hamilton,
      and I don't expect very much of him. What I came down for was to ask
      Captain Wadsworth if he would not let the people who own this house come
      back to it; but he does not think they own it at all any more, and I don't
      see what they are ever going to do. How would you feel, I'd like to know,&rdquo;
       she asked, eagerly, &ldquo;if you were an aunt and a little boy, and had to run
      away from your home, and, when you wanted to come back, found an English
      Captain living in it, who said he was going to stay there?&rdquo; Some of the
      men looked as though they could not possibly tell how they would feel if
      they were &ldquo;an aunt and a little boy,&rdquo; but they were saved the
      embarrassment of being obliged to answer such a difficult question by
      Hazel's abrupt departure? She had suddenly spied a familiar hat lurking
      behind the shrubbery near the gate, and was off in a flash. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she
      called back, &ldquo;some one is waiting for me.&rdquo; Some one was waiting for her&mdash;some
      one had been waiting for her quite awhile and had grown rather impatient
      in the waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>

      href="images/8025.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would never come, Hazel,&rdquo; said the owner of the hat, as
      soon as she swept down upon him in his retreat behind the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I did not see you till a moment ago. How long have you been here,
      and when did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over on the earliest ferry this morning. I pulled an oar and
      worked my way over. You know, Hazel, I do not like to ask Aunt Frances for
      money now if I can possibly help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she answered, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how it makes me feel, Hazel, to look up at the old house
      there with all those soldiers in it,&rdquo; said Job, rather savagely, for, of
      course, the new-comer was none other than Starlight himself. &ldquo;I'd just
      like to rush right in and choke every one of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd like to help you,&rdquo; Hazel replied warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starlight looked up astonished. It was something new for Hazel to side
      against the Red-Coats, and he gave a low whistle of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really, I would,&rdquo; Hazel reiterated. &ldquo;If King George's men had beaten
      you Americans, I suppose you wouldn't have expected to get your home back
      again; but to think that you have beaten, and yet that Captain Wadsworth
      says he is going to stay in it, and that a great lawyer, and one of your
      own officers like Colonel Hamilton, says he has a right to&mdash;well, I
      can't understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither can I,&rdquo; said Starlight, indignantly; and both children seriously
      shook their heads from side to side, as there was no gainsaying that great
      man. By mutual consent the children had turned their backs on the
      homestead and their faces in the direction of Hazel's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that, side by side, they strolled up the Bowery, and that now and
      then Hazel would pause a moment to pick a plumy spray of asters, growing
      by the wayside, must sound funny enough in the ears of any one who knows
      what the Bowery is to-day. Can it be possible that that great busy
      thoroughfare, with its block after block of cheap shops, crowded
      tenements, dime museums, and who knows what, less than a hundred years ago
      was a country lane? and where to-day train after train goes whizzing by on
      its mid-air track, birds sang in apple-tree boughs and children gathered
      daisies in spring-time and golden rod in autumn? Yes, my dear, it is
      possible; for who can measure the great transforming power of even a
      single century, and Father Time has never wrought vaster or more rapid
      changes than in the self-same hundred years which lie between the
      childhood of Starlight and Hazel, in 1783, and yours of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, true it was that our little friends strolled up Bowery Lane, for that
      was the pleasantest way home, and true it was that the lane was skirted
      with orchards and the gardens of old Dutch homesteads, where almost every
      variety of autumn flower was blooming, in a blaze of color, in the early
      September weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the prospect of a visit from Starlight, Hazel had at once abandoned all
      thought of an immediate call upon Lawyer Hamilton. Even that important
      matter could be postponed for the delight of companionship with this old
      friend, a companionship sadly interfered with by all the untoward
      circumstances of the times in which they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Colonel Hamilton says,&rdquo; Starlight resumed, after five or ten minutes,
      which had been devoted to a plying of eager questions regarding each
      others general welfare, &ldquo;that Captain Wadsworth can stay in our house,
      does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know exactly what he says; something like that, I guess; but I am
      going to find out for myself, and ask him the reasons, too. I was going
      there this morning if you had not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are awfully good, Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think so, Starlight, 'cause I know some people who don't,&rdquo;
       and Hazel indulged in a little sigh. &ldquo;I suppose I shall have a scolding
      when I get home, this very morning, for I sort of ran away. I saw the
      Albany coach coming, and I had to hurry so in time to stop it, that I did
      not think to ask Josephine's leave or anybody's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Josephine saw you go. That's the way I found you. She saw Joe
      Ainsworth help you on to the coach, and I thought perhaps you'd gone down
      to the homestead, for that's where you always used to come on the Albany
      coach, you know.&rdquo; It was Starlight's turn for a sigh now, and he drew such
      a heavy one that it seemed fairly to come from the bottom of his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Starlight,&rdquo; said Hazel, suddenly, and, no doubt, with a desire to
      brighten matters up a bit, &ldquo;an English circus came to town to-day. They
      open to-morrow. Can you stay over tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, till the day after. I heard about the circus. I've never been to a
      circus in my life, and I'd give&mdash;why, I'd give anything I own to go,
      and if that wouldn't do, I half believe I'd almost hook something.&rdquo; The
      question of ways and means was ever present nowadays to poor Job with his
      sadly depleted pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you'll need to <i>hook</i> anything, Starlight,&rdquo; answered
      Hazel, with an implied rebuke, which was, of course, quite proper, &ldquo;I have
      a little money of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I don't mean I really would, Hazel. I should think you'd know
      that I'm rather above that sort of thing. If you don't, you ought to, by
      this time. I only meant that I should very much <i>like</i> to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then next time you had better be more careful to say just what you mean,
      Job.&rdquo; Whenever Hazel had any little reproof to administer she thought it
      much more impressive to make use of Starlight's solemn little first name.

      LOWLY out of the great ocean rose the sun the next morning, shooting his
      long rays over level Long Island, spanning the East River and touching
      with rosy light the hill on which Captain Boniface had built his
      comfortable home. What a wonderful tale, provided his memory is good and
      his eyesight strong, this same old sun could tell, particularly if he had
      the moon to help him, for, whether shining brightly, or peering through
      mists of heavy clouds, between them they have seen most of this world's
      doings. One thing is certain, however change, change, change would be the
      theme of all their story. Old ocean alone remains always the same; for
      even the &ldquo;everlasting hills&rdquo; may be pierced by boring tunnels and
      disfigured by the shafts and engines of unsightly mines. And this that is
      true of the whole world is true of every inhabited corner of it, and
      doubly true of that particular corner where we find New York mapped out
      to-day. Row upon row of dwellings&mdash;mansion and hut crowding close
      upon one another; mile after mile of stores, warehouses, and every
      conceivable sort of structure, and yet only a hundred years, and lo! there
      was none of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you chance to know where St. Paul's Church stands on Broadway, on the
      block bounded by Fulton and Vesey streets? Then let me tell you that no
      longer ago than 1784 St. Paul's was on the very outskirts of the city.
      Just above it were two fine dwellings, which now form part of the Astor
      House, and a little farther on a highway leading to the right bore the
      weather-beaten sign, &ldquo;The Road to Boston,&rdquo; and another turning to the
      left, &ldquo;The Road to Albany,&rdquo; and Hazel's home was a mile or more out on
      this Albany road. Beyond were only open fields, with here and there a
      farm-dwelling or country homestead, and an occasional &ldquo;mead-house&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;tea-garden,&rdquo; for the refreshment of jaded travellers, or pleasure-seeking
      parties from the town. Nearly on the site of the present City Hall stood
      the almshouse, and in close proximity the jail, while sandwiched in
      between them were the gallows, not exactly affording what might be called
      a cheery outlook to the poor unfortunates obliged to seek such food and
      shelter as the almshouse offered. These gallows were enclosed in a
      building shaped like a Chinese summer-house, and painted in all the colors
      of the rainbow, as though trying thereby to overcome any mournful
      associations which the place might otherwise possess. A platform within
      this remarkable building supported various contrivances for conveniently
      &ldquo;dropping malefactors into eternity.&rdquo; while a row of hooks and halters
      adorned the ceiling, so that at least half a dozen offenders might be
      dispatched by the same method at one and the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wall Street, in 1783, was a street of residences. Here was the bachelor
      homestead of Daniel McCormick, upon whose stoop, on a mild and pleasant
      afternoon, you were likely to find a goodly little company of cronies and
      toadies, each and all of whom made it a point never to refuse an
      invitation to remain to dinner and enjoy his excellent pot-luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court end of the town lay in the region extending from Pearl Street
      around to the Battery, and up to Trinity Church, while the shops and
      offices were confined to Maiden Lane. On Great Dock Street, now a part of
      Pearl Street, lived the widow of John Lawrence, who, during his lifetime,
      was widely known as &ldquo;Handsome Johnnie.&rdquo; There, as Dr. Duer puts it, in his
      &ldquo;Reminiscences of an Old Yorker,&rdquo; the genial widow kept open house for her
      relatives, or rather her relatives kept open house for themselves, and
      were entertained in the roll of &ldquo;transient, constant, or perpetual&rdquo;
       visitors. All this and far more could the sun of to-day tell of the sights
      of the last century; but on the morning of which we are writing, he looked
      down upon nothing of greater interest to the average boy and girl of all
      time, than when he flashed suddenly upon the preparations going forward
      for the circus that had lately arrived from across the water, and because
      of whose arrival there was a flutter in all the child-hearts throughout
      the length and breadth of the town. Some were fluttering joyously with
      actual anticipation, and some with grave doubts as to their gaining even a
      peep at the wonderful show.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hazel Boniface, she was not only up with the sun, but up before it;
      as for Starlight, he was dressed, and &ldquo;trying to kill time&rdquo; a full hour
      before breakfast, for it had been settled the previous evening that they
      were to be allowed to attend the performance, and Captain Boniface had
      slipped the coins necessary for their admission into Starlight's safe
      keeping. Josephine, Hazel's older sister, was also early astir, stowing
      away the most inviting of luncheons within the snowy folds of a napkin,
      which in turn was committed to the keeping of a little wicker hamper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyous and beaming the children set forth, Josephine accompanying them as
      far as the gate. &ldquo;I wish I were going with you,&rdquo; she said, as she held it
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost wish you were,&rdquo; Hazel answered. &ldquo;Almost, but not quite,&rdquo; laughed
      Josephine; &ldquo;for it would spoil the fun a little, now wouldn't it, Hazel,
      to have a grown-up sister in the party? But you need not worry, dear, the
      big sister must stay at home to mind the baby sister; it's only the little
      middle-sized sister who can roam abroad, and go to the circus, and do
      whatever she likes all day long.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color came into Hazel's cheeks. She knew she did do pretty much as she
      wished from week's end to week's end, but that was not her fault. If
      nobody told her to do &ldquo;things,&rdquo; it was hardly to be expected she should do
      them. &ldquo;Will you go in my place?&rdquo; she asked, ruefully, of Josephine, who
      stood leaning on the gate with a merry, teasing look in her gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0034.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course I won't, dearie, and you come straight back and give me a
      kiss, and know that no one wishes you quite such a jolly time as your own
      sister Josephine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus speeded on their way, the children's figures grew smaller and
      smaller in the maple-shaded distance of the roadside path, and with a
      little sigh Josephine turned back to her duties within-doors. There was a
      foreboding of coming evil in her heart, and in Hazel's and Starlight's,
      too, for that matter. Children though they were, they were still old
      enough to know, that, now that the war had ended in the defeat of the
      English, those who had sided with them, as Captain Boniface had done,
      would have to suffer for it; but for to-day every worry was utterly
      forgotten. Hazel had no thought for the coming interview with Colonel
      Hamilton&mdash;which, it must be confessed, she rather dreaded&mdash;nor
      Starlight for the soldiers in the old homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right before them lay all the delights of a wonderful English circus, and
      with the lightest of hearts they set forth upon their happy expedition.
      Having strolled along in leisurely fashion, the old town clock struck
      eleven as they pressed in through the clumsy turnstile which barred the
      circus entrance, and the regular performance was not to commence until
      one. But two hours were none too much for the inspection of the wonderful
      sideshows, and wide-eyed they passed from one to the other, instinctively
      turning quickly away from two or three human monstrosities in a close,
      unsavory tent, to spend an hour of intense merriment over the antics of a
      family of monkeys in a cage in the open air. Indeed, they doled out most
      of their luncheon to the mischievous little youngsters, actually
      forgetting that there was any likelihood of their ever being hungry
      themselves and repenting of such liberality.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of fuss over a circus, you may be thinking, my little friend,
      having yourself been so many times to see &ldquo;The Greatest Show on Earth&rdquo; but
      if you had lived in the days of Hazel and Starlight, and never seen a
      circus in your life, nor a show of any kind&mdash;either great or small&mdash;then,
      perhaps, you would have been not a little excited too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before it was at all necessary, and after much consultation and
      numerous experiments at different angles, the children seated themselves
      at the precise point which they had concluded, on the whole, offered
      greatest advantages, and then they impatiently watched the uncomfortable
      benches become gradually filled, and certain significant preparations
      going forward on the part of the gayly-liveried lackeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the orchestra of three ill-tuned instruments struck up a
      preliminary march, the low, red-topped gates of the ring swung open, and
      the gorgeous company pranced in, dazzling and brilliant indeed, in the
      eyes of the children. What did it matter if tinsel were tarnished, and
      satins and velvets travel-stained and bedraggled. They saw it not. It was
      all glitter and shimmer to them, and, oh, those beautiful, long-tailed
      horses with their showy trappings! Hazel silently made up her mind on the
      spot, that she would be a circus-rider herself as soon as she was old
      enough, <i>if</i> her father would let her. She changed her mind later in
      the day, however, owing to certain unexpected experiences, and was
      thankful enough that she had not openly expressed her resolution of a few
      hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway in the performance, as the clown had announced, for they did not
      have printed programmes in those days, there was to be some lofty tumbling
      by the Strauss brothers, and at the proper moment in they came leaping and
      jumping. They were all attired in the regulation long hose, short
      trousers, and sleeveless jackets of the professional tumbler, but it was
      easy enough for any child to detect at a glance that it was quite
      impossible that they should belong to the same family. They were of all
      ages and sizes, but the youngest performer did not appear to be more than
      twelve; he was a handsome little fellow, with a fine dark complexion, and
      from the first both Hazel's and Starlight's attention centred upon him. He
      proved himself the most agile of all the brothers, eagerly watching for
      his turn every time, and apparently enjoying the performance almost as
      keenly as the audience. But it happened after a while, that when he had
      just accomplished the feat of turning a double somersault from the top of
      a spring-board, he did not attempt to rejoin the other leapers and
      tumblers, but crept from the place where he had landed in the sawdust to
      the edge of the ring, seated himself, with his little slippered feet
      straight out before him, and leaned comfortably back against its rail. The
      spot he had chosen was directly underneath where Hazel and Starlight were
      sitting, and being in the first row they naturally leaned over to
      investigate matters. He sat there so comfortably, and his older brothers
      seemed so indifferent to the fact that he had dropped from their number,
      that the children came to the conclusion that he was simply taking a
      little permitted rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Starlight made so bold as to ask, &ldquo;Say, Straussie, you didn't hurt
      yourself any way, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of Starlight's voice the little fellow looked up surprised.
      &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I often slip my knee-cap, or something like
      that when I take that double 'sault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it hurt you now,&rdquo; asked Hazel, with real solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little. I can't jump any more to-day. The men know what's the
      matter with me. I'll be all right in a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like being in a circus?&rdquo; continued Starlight, for it was even more
      interesting to converse with a member of the troupe than to watch the
      performance of the troupe itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the jumping and tumbling; that's all the part I like,&rdquo; ending with
      a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not easy to carry on a conversation at the distance they were
      from each other, particularly as the tumblers, as if to add to the
      excitement, kept up an almost ceaseless hallooing and shouting. Now it
      happened that the ring, with the exception of the gates of entrance, was
      formed by a short canvas curtain suspended from a circular iron rail.
      Observing this, a happy thought occurred to Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Straussie,&rdquo; he said, in a penetrating whisper, &ldquo;I'd like to
      talk with you. Couldn't you creep under the curtain there, and I'll drop
      down between the seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could,&rdquo; answered the little tumbler, grasping the situation at
      once, and suiting the action to the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could drop too,&rdquo; urged Hazel, longingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you stay where you are. It wouldn't do, Hazel; folks might notice,&rdquo;
       and Hazel was sensible enough to see the wisdom of the remark. As it was,
      every one was by far too much absorbed to take account of the fact that a
      little fellow inside the ring and a little fellow outside of it had
      disappeared at one and the same moment. And so it happened that all
      unsuspected a very important conversation was carried on, and a remarkable
      scheme planned under the crowded benches of that day's performance.
      Meanwhile Hazel &ldquo;sat on pins and needles.&rdquo; Even &ldquo;the most educated
      elephant in the world&rdquo; failed to rouse much interest in a little maiden
      who knew an absorbing conversation to be going on almost within earshot
      and in which she longed to have a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Starlight, as soon as he had dropped safely to
      the dry grass, and had stretched himself beside the little tumbler, who
      sat with his knees gathered close to him and his hands clasped round them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; answered the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not your real name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what they call me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the circus people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters simply nodded &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Somehow he did not seem at first inclined to
      be quite as communicative as Starlight would have wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be fun to wear clothes like those,&rdquo; he said, after a pause,
      eyeing his new friend from head to foot with evident admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's kind of fun for a while, but there isn't much real fun.
      Everything's only kind of fun, and there isn't any fun at all about most
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight couldn't quite agree with these sage remarks, although he had
      himself of late been seeing a great deal of the darker side of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you're not very well, Flutters,&rdquo; he said, seriously; &ldquo;or perhaps
      you're tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm well enough, but I'm not over-happy,&rdquo; answered the boy, who, from
      little association with children and much with older people, had formed
      rather a mature way of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you feel like that?&rdquo; asked Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lots of things. There's no one who cares for me 'cept to make money
      out of me. That's kind of hard on a fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you get some of the money yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a penny. You see, I'm 'prenticed to the manager till I'm eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who apprenticed you?&rdquo; said Starlight, taking care to speak correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manager, I suppose; but I did not know anybody had to 'prentice you.
      I thought you just 'prenticed yourself by promising to work for your
      board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. You oughtn't to have made such a promise. If you were
      worth anything to the manager you were worth part of the money you earned.
      Besides, I don't think anybody can apprentice a boy except his parents or
      his guardian, or some one who has charge of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nobody's had charge of me this long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that big man with the great black moustache the manager?&rdquo; asked
      Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is, and he's a tough one,&rdquo; and Flutters pressed his lips tightly
      together and shook his head by way of emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't look kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks doesn't look things what they never are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you cut the circus, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight nodded yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; was Flutters's pointed question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anywhere,&rdquo; somewhat vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well; but board, you know, and a blanket to roll yourself
      in at night is a little better than nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Starlight, and then sat silent a few moments, drawing
      his fingers, rake fashion, through the dry grass in front of him, and
      evidently thinking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;if you ran away I believe you'd find a home
      and somebody to care for you&mdash;we'd look out for you ourselves, Aunt
      Frances and I, till something turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, really?&rdquo; and Flutters leaned very close to Starlight in his
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm sure we would. Will you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I'll do it now,&rdquo; and Flutters got straightway on to &ldquo;all
      fours,&rdquo; as if he deemed that the most silent and effective mode of escape,
      although the benches were hardly so low as to render it necessary for a
      boy of his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll be caught in a minute in those&mdash;fixings.&rdquo; Starlight did
      not think there was enough of them to deserve the respectable name of
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters sat down in despair. &ldquo;Then there's no use; I may as well give it
      up if I have to go back for anything.&rdquo; Flutters stood in such fear of the
      manager that he felt sure he could read his very thoughts. He honestly
      meant that he would abandon the whole scheme rather than face Mr. Bradshaw
      with such a design in mind, and he looked down at his spangled slippers
      and bedraggled tights in most woe-begone fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Starlight, after a moment's serious cogitation; &ldquo;wait
      here a minute,&rdquo; and taking hold of a board directly under the seat where
      he had sat, he pulled himself up to his place beside Hazel. She was ready
      with a host of eager questions, but Starlight, in the most imperative of
      whispers, gave her quickly to understand that there was no time for
      anything of that sort. &ldquo;Just do as I tell you, Hazel,&rdquo; some one overheard
      him say, but more than that they fortunately did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Starlight disappeared, and a little red cloak, which
      Josephine had made Hazel carry with her, had disappeared too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long afterward, but it seemed a very long while to Hazel, the
      entertainment came to a close with a wild sort of farce, which everybody
      seemed to think pretty funny, but Hazel did not so much as smile. She had
      neither seen nor heard what was going on; she had an important little
      piece of business ahead of her, and could hardly wait to be off and about
      it. If her seat had not been quite in the middle of the row, so that she
      would have been obliged to crowd past a long line of people, she simply
      could not have waited; and now that the performance was actually over, she
      energetically pushed her way through one group after another, lingering
      about as if loath to desert the charms of the circus, and was clear of the
      great tent in almost less time than it takes to tell it. Off she darted
      down the road&mdash;down Broadway one would say today&mdash;for the
      gateway to the circus enclosure was exactly on the spot where Niblo's
      Theatre has for so many years set forth its varied amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one farm-house in the immediate neighborhood, and thither
      Hazel flew, bringing up at the threshold of its old Dutch kitchen in a
      state of breathless excitement. &ldquo;Mrs. V an Wyck,&rdquo; she cried with what
      little breath she had left, as she peered over the half door that barred
      her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment, Hazel,&rdquo; came a voice from the depths. &ldquo;I am putting some
      curd in the cheese press; I'll be up in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minute afforded Hazel a much-needed breathing space, and when a
      rosy-cheeked Dutch Frau emerged from the horizontal doorway of the cool,
      clean-smelling cellar, Hazel was able to make known her request in quite
      coherent fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Mrs. Van Wyck, <i>will</i> you let me have a pair ol Hanss trousers,'
      and some shoes and a coat, and please, please don't ask me what I want
      them for!&rdquo; for she saw the question shaping itself on Frau Van Wyck's
      lips; &ldquo;I'll bring them home safe to-morrow, and tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little woman looked decidedly astonished, but the child was so urgent,
      and withal such a little favorite of hers, that she could but accede to
      her request, and in a trice Hazel was off again with the coveted articles,
      in a snug bundle, swinging from one hand as she ran.

    <p>
      T may seem at first somewhat improbable that Flutters should have been
      able.. to make his escape from the circus grounds without being noticed,
      but escape he did under Starlight's cautious guidance. Every one was still
      intent on the performance itself; outside were only a few straggling
      employees of the company, and they were too much preoccupied with the
      special duties assigned to them to pay any heed to the fact that a couple
      of boys were making their way through the grounds. Indeed, it was
      decidedly too common an occurrence to excite any suspicion. To be sure,
      Hazel's cloak concealed neither the head nor feet of little Flutters; but
      velvet cap and satin slippers were tucked safely away, and the absence of
      hat and shoes was by no means unusual among the boyish rabble that found
      their way into the circus. The most dangerous, because the most
      conspicuous move in their plan of escape, would be the scaling of the high
      board fence, so they naturally made their way to its most remote corner.
      It needed but a moment for Flutters to scramble to its top and drop on the
      other side. Starlight made more clumsy work of it. It was not an easy
      thing to keep one's hold on the slippery inside posts of the fence, and
      when he was near the top he heard some one calling at his back, which did
      not tend to help matters. Astride the fence at last, however, he glanced
      down and saw a forlorn old man close at his heels, one of the drudges of
      the circus, whose duty it was to keep things cleared up about the grounds.

    </div>
    <p>
      Look you there, cried, in a cracked Flutters and Starlight were safe out
      of sight now, and smiled at each other with supreme satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Robbin's voice,&rdquo; chuckled Flutters, as they walked off through the
      woods that grew close up to the circus; &ldquo;he could get over a mountain as
      easily as over that fence; he has the rheumatics awful bad, and he's very
      old besides, He's the only one I mind about leaving.&rdquo; Poor old Bobbin
      stood gazing up at the fence, and seemed wisely to come to the conclusion
      that there was no harm in a boy's leaving the circus in that manner if he
      chose. The harm would be if he attempted to come in that way; and so
      hobbled off to his dreary, back-breaking task of gathering up the papers
      and stray bits of rubbish constantly accumulating on every side. It is
      possible, too, that even if he had recognized Flutters, and guessed his
      motive, he would not have tried to detain him. He had once been a tumbler
      himself, and knew enough of the trials of circus life to be willing,
      perhaps, that a promising little fellow should escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grove in which the boys found themselves was the only piece of old
      forest land that remained in the near vicinity of the town, and was fitted
      up with rude tables and benches for the use of picnic parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starlight led the way to one of these tables, sat down, and comfortably
      rested his folded arms upon it, as though they had reached their point of
      destination. Here was where Hazel was to meet them and, while they waited,
      the boys entertained each other with little scraps of their life
      histories; but Starlight did not for a moment forget to keep eye and ear
      on guard for any one approaching. There was a hollow tree just at
      Flutters's back, into which he could tumble in a flash and be securely hid
      should it become necessary. But the sound of their own low voices and the
      occasional fall of a pine cone or crackling of a branch was all that broke
      the stillness. At last they heard a footfall in the distance, but
      Starlight knew that quick, short little step, and there was no need for
      Flutters to take refuge in the tree. Hazel had come with the precious
      bundle, that was all, and Flutters was straightway arrayed in Hans Van
      Wyck's clothes, his dark little face not at all agreeing with the
      Dutch-looking coat and trousers; but they answered the purpose of complete
      disguise, and what more could be wished for? So the children set out for
      home at a brisk pace, not by the way they had come, but, so far as
      possible, by cross cuts and quiet lanes, to avoid observation. That their
      little tongues moved even faster than their feet was not at all strange,
      for, of course, they wanted to know all about each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an Italian, Flutters?&rdquo; asked Hazel, in the course of the
      cross-questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters smiled, and shook his head in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I guess you're Spanish,&rdquo; remarked Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not Spanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel and Starlight looked mystified. He was certainly neither American
      nor English with that dark skin of his.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0045.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of people does that sort of hair grow on?&rdquo; Flutters asked,
      running his hand through his tight-curling hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On&mdash;on darkeys,&rdquo; answered Hazel, ruefully. &ldquo;But it does not curl so
      tight as&mdash;as some darkeys,&rdquo; hoping there might be a mistake
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for me,&rdquo; Flutters answered, cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are&mdash;you&mdash;a regular&mdash;darkey&mdash;really?&rdquo; questioned
      Starlight, with a little pause between each word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm what they call a mulatto; that's not quite so bad as an
      out-and-out darkey, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Flutters, don't you mind?&rdquo; asked Hazel, who was disappointed enough
      that the hero of this thrilling adventure should prove to be only a kind
      of negro. Hazel had an idea as, sadly enough, many far older and wiser
      than she had in those days&mdash;and, indeed, for long years afterward&mdash;that
      negroes were little better than cattle, and that it was quite right to buy
      and sell them in the same fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the use of minding?&rdquo; said Flutters, in response to her
      sympathetic question; &ldquo;minding would not make things any different, Miss
      Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time he had called her by name, and Hazel, born little
      aristocrat that she was, was glad to discover that &ldquo;he knew his place,&rdquo; as
      the phrase goes&mdash;so far, at least, as to put the Miss before her
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the children trudged along for a while in silence, each busy
      with their own thoughts. Starlight was beginning to have some misgivings
      as to the course he had taken. It might, after all, become a serious
      question what to do with Flutters. He began to wonder how Aunt Frances
      would look when he should go back to the farm-house next day with his
      little protégé in tow. She would be pretty sure to say, &ldquo;What are you
      thinking of, Job dear? It is not at all as though we were in our own home,
      you know. We cannot allow the Van Vleets to take this strange little boy
      into their home for our sakes; though no doubt they would be willing to do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the more he thought of it, the more he felt sure that would be just
      what she would say; strange that all this had not occurred to him before,
      and a little sickening sensation&mdash;half presentiment, half regret&mdash;swept
      over him. So it was that Starlight trudged along in silence, for, of
      course, such thoughts as those could not be spoken with Flutters there to
      hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hazel, she was turning over a fine little scheme of her own in her
      mind. She was a hopeful little body, and it did not take long for her to
      recover from the despair into which the discovery of Flutters's
      nationality had thrown her. &ldquo;Why, look here,&rdquo; she thought to herself, &ldquo;I
      believe I'm glad he's a darkey after all. It was awful cute to hear him
      say 'Miss Hazel;' how nice it would be to have him for a sort of
      body-servant, just as so many officers have body-servants! He could brush
      my clothes, and groom the pony, and tend to my flower garden, and just
      stand 'round, ready to do whatever I should wish,&rdquo; and so it was that
      Hazel trudged along in silence, for she thought it wiser not to announce,
      as yet, the exact nature of her thoughtful meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Flutters&mdash;well, it would have been hard to tell about what he was
      thinking. He was a most sensitive little fellow, and strong and intense
      were the emotions that often played through his lithe frame, so strong and
      intense at times as to find no other expression than in a perceptible
      little tremble from head to foot; it was this peculiarity that had won for
      him the expressive name of &ldquo;Flutters&rdquo; among the circus people. Now, of
      course, his state of mind was joyous and satisfied. Kind friends and a
      home in this new land! What more could be desired, and the happiest look
      played over his handsome face, for Flutters was handsome, and the dark
      olive complexion was most to be thanked for it; but the light went out of
      his face when, after a while, he glanced toward Starlight and saw his
      troubled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he divined its cause. &ldquo;Are you sorry you took me?&rdquo; he asked,
      coming to an abrupt standstill in the brier-hedged lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly;&rdquo; Starlight was betrayed into a partial confession of the
      truth by the suddenness of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how that hurt poor little Flutters, with his sensitive temperament!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not too late,&rdquo; he said, turning and looking in the direction they
      had come; &ldquo;I think I can find my way back. They'd never know I'd regular
      runned away;&rdquo; but there was a mistiness in the bright little darkey eyes,
      and an actual ache in the poor little heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters, <i>I</i> am not sorry then,&rdquo; said Hazel, warmly; and laying a
      firm hand on each shoulder, she turned him right about face again in the
      direction of her own home. &ldquo;Just you trust to me, Flutters, and you'll
      never be sorry you ran away from that miserable old circus&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, so completely was all gloom dispelled by these kind words, that
      back in a flash came the glad look into Flutters's face, and from that
      moment he was Hazel's sworn servant. Starlight looked rather ashamed of
      himself, but, after all, his fears had some foundation, and he was
      thankful enough thus to have Hazel take matters into her own hands, and
      more than share the responsibility. The sun was already down as the
      children neared the house, standing in clear-cut outline against the
      September sky. There were no clouds, only a marvellous gradation of color,
      shading imperceptibly from the dark, dark blue of the river and the hills
      beyond, up into the red glow of the sunset, and then again by some subtle
      transformation into a wonderful pale turquoise high overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a beautiful fall evening, and Captain and Mrs. Boniface and
      Josephine, seated on the wide, pillared porch, were waiting for the coming
      of the children, and the exciting narrative that was sure to follow.
      &ldquo;Kate, the bonny-face baby,&rdquo; as they used to call her, was there too, a
      sunny, winsome little daughter, almost three years old, and Harry Avery
      besides, Job Starlight's cousin, a good-looking young fellow, and who
      lately had managed to spend a good deal of time at the Bonifaces. He had
      sailed over that morning from Paulus Hook (which, by the way, was the old
      name for Jersey City) with a fine little plan in mind for the day&mdash;a
      plan which he had already promised Hazel should some time be carried out;
      but the absence of the children had made it necessary to postpone it for
      at least twenty-four hours. This Harry Avery was the oldest of a varied
      assortment of little brothers, and his home was in New London,
      Connecticut. But two years before he had enlisted as a volunteer on board
      a brig named &ldquo;The Fair American,&rdquo; and not one of the little brothers had
      ever had a sight of the big brother since. He had had a sorry enough time
      of it, too, for eighteen months of the twenty-four since he left home had
      been passed in the prison-ship &ldquo;Jersey,&rdquo; and he had only been released
      within the last few weeks, when the success of the American armies
      compelled the English to discharge all their prisoners of war. The old
      ship where so many brave men had lost their lives by privation and disease
      now lay a great deserted hulk in the waters of Wallabout Bay, and what
      Harry had come over to propose was a sail over to have a look at her. He
      knew it would interest the children immensely, and he had proposed to Mrs.
      Boniface that Josephine should go with them, and Josephine, only too glad
      to fall in with any plan that involved being out on the water, had that
      morning concocted some very delicious little iced cakes with a view to the
      luncheon they would take with them on the morrow. Meanwhile, the children
      were almost at the gate. &ldquo;Why, there's Cousin Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Starlight,
      whose eyes were good at a long range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Hazel, excitedly; and when they had passed a few steps
      farther on, she added, &ldquo;Now, Flutters, this is the best place for you to
      stop, and remember, when you hear me call, come quick as anything.&rdquo;
       Flutters smiled assent, and stepped into the deeper shadow of one of the
      maples that edged the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you are at last,&rdquo; called Captain Boniface a few moments later
      from where he sat smoking in a great easy-chair on the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here we are,&rdquo; answered Starlight, and they marched up the path and
      took their seats on the porch, Hazel having first kissed the family all
      round, not at all reluctantly including &ldquo;Cousin Harry,&rdquo; for his prison
      experience made him a wonderful hero in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they right away began to give an account, interrupted by a good
      many questions, of all they had seen and done. Mrs. Boniface thought, and
      thought rightly, that she detected a little sense of disappointment in
      their description, but did not know that that was easily accounted for by
      the insight they had had into the inner workings of a circus. They had
      indeed been greatly impressed with the velvet and spangles, but only until
      they had learned through Flutters what heavy hearts velvet and spangles
      could cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, at the close of quite a vivid description on Hazel's part of the
      grand entrance march, which had proved to both the children the most
      impressive feature, Harry Avery remarked, just by way of taking some part
      in the conversation, &ldquo;that they ought to have brought a bit of the circus
      home with them for the benefit of people who had not been so fortunate as
      to see it.&rdquo; Could there have been a better opportunity for the
      introduction of Flutters?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did bring a bit of it home,&rdquo; cried Hazel; and then, stepping to the
      edge of the porch, she called, &ldquo;<i>Flutters, Flutters</i>,&rdquo; at the top of
      her strong little lungs. Of course the Bonifaces looked on astonished at
      this performance, while Starlight, from suppressed excitement, bit his lip
      till he almost made the blood come; but in a second, head over heels in a
      series of somersaults up the path, bounded a remarkable little creature in
      satin slippers, velvet cap and all, as real a bit of a circus as Cousin
      Harry or any one else could have desired. The little tumbler was, of
      course, acting under orders, and brought up at the step of the porch with
      the most beaming smile imaginable, and a most gracious little bow.

      &ldquo;Come right up, Flutters,&rdquo; was Hazel's reassuring invitation, and nothing
      abashed, but still beaming and smiling, so great was his confidence in
      Hazel, Flutters mounted the steps, swung himself into the hammock that was
      strung across the porch, and drew the netted meshes close about him, as
      though conscious of the scarcity of his apparel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause for a moment&mdash;that is, no word was spoken, but the
      four pairs of eyes belonging to Captain and Mrs. Boniface and Josephine
      and Harry were riveted upon Hazel, asking as plainly as words, &ldquo;What does
      this mean?&rdquo; while Starlight's eyes were urging her in an imploring fashion
      to tell about it all right away. As for Flutters, the complacent, trustful
      gaze with which he regarded his little benefactress implied that he was
      sure she would proceed to explain matters to the entire satisfaction of
      everybody. Meantime little Kate looked on in admiring wonder, but
      fortunately her pretty head did not need to trouble itself with
      &ldquo;explanations of things.&rdquo; She only knew that that little fellow in the
      hammock was &ldquo;awfully funny.&rdquo; and extended her pretty hands toward him as
      though she would very much like to touch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hazel began at last with much the same air as a veritable showman,
      &ldquo;this little boy is named Flutters, and he did belong to the circus, but
      he does not belong to it any more. He has run away, and we've helped him
      to do it. Somehow he's quite alone in the world, and he has to s'port
      himself, so he joined the circus 'cause he found he could do what the
      other tumblers did, and'cause he heard they were coming to America. But he
      has not been at all happy in the circus,&rdquo; and Hazel, pausing a moment,
      looked toward Flutters for confirmation of this sad statement, and
      Flutters bore witness to its truth by gravely shaking his head from side
      to side. Indeed all through her narration it was most amusing to watch his
      expression, so perfectly did it correspond with every word she spoke.
      Little folk and old folk have a fashion of letting each passing thought
      write itself legibly on the face. It is only the strong &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; folk
      who take great care that no one shall ever know what they chance to be
      thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Starlight began to show a desire to take a share in the
      telling of the story, but Hazel would none of it. She thought, perhaps
      unjustly, that he had proved somewhat of a coward in the latter part of
      the transaction; at any rate, he himself had pushed her to the front, and
      there she meant to stay. &ldquo;No, he has not been at all happy,&rdquo; she
      continued; &ldquo;indeed, the manager has often been very cruel to him; but I
      will tell you about that another time&rdquo; (for her eyes were growing a little
      tearful at the mere remembrance of some things Flutters had told them);
      &ldquo;and the way we came to know about it was this: sometimes when Flutters
      takes a great jump from the spring-board and turns a somersault two times
      in the air, he slips his knee-cap&mdash;that's what you call it, Flutters,
      isn't it?&rdquo; (Flutters nodded yes), &ldquo;and then he has to slip it back again
      himself, and it hurts a good deal, so that he can't jump any more for a
      while. Well, to-day he slipped it, and then he crawled over underneath
      where we sat, and we talked with him a little; then Starlight told him to
      creep under the benches when no one was looking, and Starlight dropped
      down between the seats and talked with him some more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we arranged,&rdquo; Starlight now interrupted in such an unmistakably
      determined manner that Hazel allowed him to continue, &ldquo;how he should run
      away, and he didn't even go back for his clothes, because he says that the
      manager can almost see what a fellow's thinking about, and he didn't dare.
      So when we had fixed everything I climbed up to Hazel and told her what
      she was to do, and then I dropped down again, and Flutters put on Hazel's
      cloak so as to cover him up a little, and we scooted. We came near being
      found out once, but we got over the great fence safe at last and into
      Beekman's woods. There Hazel was to meet us with some of Hans Van Wyck's
      clothes, if she could get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I did get them,&rdquo; chimed in Hazel, for it was surely her turn once
      more, &ldquo;and&mdash;but, oh!&rdquo; stopping suddenly, &ldquo;the clothes! Starlight, do
      hurry and get them, or some one coming along the road may run off with
      them.&rdquo; Starlight obeyed, frightened enough at the thought of the possible
      loss of the borrowed articles, and quickly returning with them to the
      great relief of both Hazel and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the story went on again, turn and turn about, Flutters gaining
      courage to join in now and then, till at last, when the twilight had given
      place to the sort of half darkness of a starlight night, and the
      fire-flies were flashing their little lanterns on every side, they had
      told all there was to tell, and three foot-sore little people confessed
      they were tired and sleepy and hungry, and glad enough to go indoors and
      do justice to a most inviting little supper, which Josephine had slipped
      away some time before to prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bonny Kate&rdquo; (as she was called more than half the time, after a certain
      wilful but very charming young woman in one of Shakespeare's great plays)
      had long ago fallen asleep, and lay just where her mother, running indoors
      for a moment, had stowed her away in a corner of the great hair-cloth sofa
      in the dining-room. One pretty hand was folded under her rosy cheek, and
      such a merry smile played over her sweet face! She surely must have been
      dreaming of a remarkable little fellow, in beautiful velvet and spangles,
      coming head over heels up a garden path.

      T is one thing to help a much-abused and unhappy little member of a circus
      troupe to run away from his unhappy surroundings; it is quite another
      thing to provide for all his future, particularly if, like Flutters, he
      has not a penny to his name nor a stitch to his back, none more
      serviceable, that is, than the ring costume of a high and lofty tumbler.
      And so it was that Mrs. Boniface and Josephine and Harry sat up well into
      the night, laughing heartily now and then over the funny side of the
      children's adventure, but talking gravely enough most of the time of its
      more serious side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can make out,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;Starlight rather expected to
      bring Flutters over to the farm to-morrow and ask Aunt Frances to care for
      him, at least till he found somebody else who would. I imagine his heart
      rather failed him later, as it ought to. Aunt Frances has enough to bother
      her at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't blame the children for helping the poor little fellow, do
      you?&rdquo; said Josephine, warmly; &ldquo;I think almost anyone would have done the
      same thing under the same circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, Miss Josephine, but that doesn't dispose of the troublesome
      question, What is now to be done with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, there are questions to be met more troublesome than that,&rdquo;
       said Captain Boniface, joining for the first time in the conversation, and
      he had only too good reason for speaking as he did. Early in the evening a
      letter had been brought him, to which no one had paid any attention. It
      was a daily occurrence for a messenger to turn in at the gate with a note
      for the Captain, since he had been for the last eight years the principal
      furnisher of supplies to the English soldiers stationed in the city, and
      had need both to write and receive many letters. Indeed, so loyal had he
      been to King George that, at the very commencement of the Revolution, he
      had joined the English army, but had had the misfortune to be very
      seriously wounded in the first battle that was fought. When at last, after
      weeks of constant suffering, he was able to be moved, General Gage, under
      whom he served, had contrived to send him home by easy stages along the
      Boston post-road, under protection of an English escort; and Captain
      Boniface always declared, and no doubt he was right about it, that nothing
      short of his wife's careful nursing would ever have brought him through.
      But after that it was out of the question for him to rejoin the army, so
      he must needs stay quietly at home and aid the King's cause as best he
      could by helping to feed the King's soldiers. All this, of course, had
      made enemies of most of the Captain's old friends. Harry Avery was almost
      the only exception; and now that the Colonies had been successful, matters
      were looking pretty serious for him and for every American who had sided
      with the King. The note that had just been brought to him proved a very
      threatening one. It as much as ordered him to leave the country, saying
      &ldquo;that there was but one safe course for him and his, and that was to be
      gone instantly; that New York had no further use for him; that the sooner
      her streets and coffee-houses were rid of him the better, and that he
      would simply be taking his life in his hands if he stayed.&rdquo; It was truly a
      terribly alarming letter, but Captain Boniface, knowing that sooner or
      later his wife and Josephine would have to know about it, now broke in
      upon the conversation and read it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has dared to write you that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Boniface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four old friends, Mary; that is the saddest part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boniface sat pale and silent, looking straight before her, and not
      hearing another word that was said. She knew her husband well enough to
      feel assured that no such letter would move him a step from his home. Not
      he! He would remain and live the bitter persecution down. But would he be
      allowed to live it down? There were cruel words in that letter. &ldquo;By
      remaining you simply take your life in your hands,&rdquo; it said, and the
      terrible threat sent all sorts of dread possibilities thronging through
      her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With anxious faces, and quick-beating hearts, Josephine and her mother
      listened, as Harry Avery and the Captain talked late into the night. It
      was a great comfort to realize that although Harry was a Whig, and a
      strong one, too, he did not harbor any bitter feeling against them.
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought Josephine gladly, &ldquo;there are others like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though Harry must have seen the gratitude in her expressive
      eyes, as he continued again and again to reassure the Captain of his full
      sympathy, and his determination to be of assistance to him in every
      possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what will you do about it, father? Josephine asked, as just at
      midnight, she leaned over his chair to say good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do about it, child?&rdquo; he said, taking her hands in both of his,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, stay just where I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boniface shook her head gravely, as she and Josephine left the room
      together. She had known so well beforehand that he would say exactly that.

      HAT a queer sort of thing it is, this regularly going to sleep and waking
      up again once in every twenty-four hours; but people who have had a little
      experience in not going to sleep regularly, and in waking up at most
      unheard-of and irregular hours, will tell you that that experience is a
      deal queerer, and not so pleasant by half. Some of the little folk who have
      need to be coaxed and urged to bed six nights out of the seven, would
      hardly dare to fret, I imagine, if they only knew that to be a sound
      sleeper is an accomplishment sorely envied by some of those grown-up
      people who may sit up as late as they choose. And if one of those wakeful,
      grown-up people should some day ask you, &ldquo;What is the secret of your sound
      sleeping, my little friend?&rdquo; just tell them that you think it is because
      you do not worry. Then if they say, &ldquo;That's all very well; children have
      no need to worry, they have fathers and mothers to lean upon tell them
      that they, too, have a Father, One far more kind and loving than any
      earthly father, and that they could lie down at night as free from worry
      as any child if they would;&rdquo; and who knows but they will learn a blessed
      lesson from you that will be well worth the learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this little reverie has all been suggested by the fact that the
      Boniface household was waking up, all save old Dinah, the cook, for she
      had been up for an hour or more. She had once been Hazel's nurse, and,
      since the beginning of the war, was the only servant the Bonifaces could
      afford to keep. How comfortable she made them, that faithful old Dinah, so
      that all one had to do was to waken and wash, and brush and dress, and
      then sit down to steaming coffee, delicate rolls, and the most savory
      little rasher of bacon, which Dinah always added as a &ldquo;relisher,&rdquo; as she
      called it, to the more substantial part of the breakfast. Yes, they were
      waking, all of them, from anxious Captain Boniface to happy little
      Flutters, for Dinah's vigorous ringing of the rising bell had thoroughly
      done its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each busy brain was taking up again the manifold threads of thought which
      had slipped from its hold when sleep had stolen across it so gently the
      night before. Captain Boniface instantly remembered the angry letter, as,
      of course, did Mrs. Boniface and Josephine, and so their waking was rather
      heavy hearted. Harry instantly remembered it too, but his second thought
      was of the pretty sail-boat moored down at the Boniface wharf, and of the
      plan for the day, and he was glad to open his eyes on blue skies and the
      sunshine that flooded his eastward room. Flutters woke with a smile.
      Indeed, he doubted if he should ever do anything but smile again, so sure
      was he that he had turned a very happy corner in his life. Starlight
      roomed with Flutters, and his first thought when he opened his eyes was
      how they were to manage to return those clothes of Hans Van Wyck's, that
      Flutters was getting into with such an air of complacent ownership.
      Hazel's little mind took its first morning flight in the same direction as
      Harry Avery's. The sail-boat, the bay sparkling in the sunshine, the visit
      to the old prison-ship&mdash;it all meant so much to her enthusiastic,
      pleasure-loving temperament. A certain uncomfortable and premeditated call
      upon Colonel Hamilton could easily be postponed to an indefinite future,
      with such delightful anticipations in the definite present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems heartless to be going off for a day's jaunt, when father has so
      much to trouble him,&rdquo; Josephine said, when, soon after breakfast, the
      little party of five, basketed and equipped, were starting down to the
      wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Josephine,&rdquo; answered her sweet-faced mother, holding bonny
      Kate by the hand as she spoke. &ldquo;We will try and keep dear old papa cheery,
      won't we, little daughter?&rdquo; then, seeing that Josephine still lingered, as
      though reluctant to go, she added, cheerily, &ldquo;nothing would be gained by
      your staying, Josephine. Your father has some office work that will keep
      him in the house, so you can think of him as safe at home all day, and we
      are both of us glad enough to have you enjoy a little change.&rdquo; So,
      somewhat relieved in her mind, Josephine hurried down and joined the
      Others, and soon the &ldquo;Gretchen,&rdquo; with her white sail spread to the crisp
      morning breeze, sped out on the river, fairly dancing along the crests of
      the white caps that splashed against her prow with such a continuous and
      merry little thump and splutter.

      Wind and tide favored them, and Harry was an excellent sailor, so that in
      a comparatively short time they had left the waters of the Hudson behind
      them, had rounded Fort George, the Battery of to-day, and were headed up
      the East River, with New York on the one side, and the then scattered town
      of Brooklyn on the other. Skilfully tacking in long slants from shore to
      shore, the wharves and shipping were soon exchanged for the sloping banks
      of Manhattan Island on the left, and of Long Island on the right, and then
      suddenly the dismasted hulk of the old &ldquo;Jersey&rdquo; loomed up before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a dreary enough looking object to any one, but if, like Harry, you
      had been a prisoner aboard of her for eighteen long months, you would,
      like him, no doubt, have shuddered at the sight of her. Josephine
      shuddered too. &ldquo;Oh, do not let us go any nearer!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was Harry's quick response, for, in point of fact, nothing
      pleased him better than to comply with Josephine's slightest wish, so the
      &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; veered off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! can't we go aboard?&rdquo; cried Flutters, with a world of disappointment
      in his tone, for in imagination he had already scaled the gangway ladder
      that hung at her larboard side, and turned more than one somersault on the
      wide sweep of her upper deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, child!&rdquo; answered Hazel, who was fast assuming a most patronizing
      air toward her little protégé; &ldquo;no one would think of going <i>aboard</i>
      of her, would they, Cousin Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why not?&rdquo; Flutters asked, half-impatiently, for Harry, giving his
      attention for the moment to the management of the boat, did not at once
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, finally, &ldquo;there has been far too much sickness in that
      old hulk for any one to safely venture aboard of her; she has been
      responsible for the lives of eleven thousand men. I doubt if the strongest
      and longest of north winds could ever blow her free from the fever that
      must be lurking in her rotten timbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a new phase of the matter to Flutters, and he subsided at once
      into thoughtful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this would be a good place to anchor,&rdquo; suggested Harry, but
      waited a moment till Josephine had given her consent before letting the
      anchor run the length of its rope and bury itself in the mud bottom
      beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; had settled into the position determined for her
      by the tide, the little party of five ranged themselves about the boat, so
      as to be as comfortable as possible, for there they meant to stay for the
      next hour, or two, or three, as the case might be. It had been for some
      time a thoroughly understood matter between Hazel and Harry Avery, that
      whenever the day should come for this trip to the &ldquo;Jersey,&rdquo; they were to
      anchor their boat in <i>full sight</i> of her, and <i>then</i> and <i>there</i>
      he was to tell them the &ldquo;whole story&rdquo;&mdash;from the day he volunteered
      till the day of his release in the previous summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters, who had been made acquainted with the object of the expedition,
      waited, with a charming native sense of the &ldquo;fitness of things,&rdquo; until the
      others had chosen their places; then he threw himself at Harry's feet, in
      one of the graceful positions so natural to him, and which even Hans Van
      Wyck's rough, homespun clothes did not altogether succeed in hiding. It
      was wonderful to look into Flutters's upturned face&mdash;such complete
      satisfaction, such tranquil happiness shone out of it. Even in those
      exciting moments when every nerve and tissue was thrilling under Harry's
      narration of the dark features of his prison life, a smile still seemed to
      be lurking in the corners of his expressive mouth. Yesterday, a lonely
      little tumbler in a dreary, tawdry circus company; to-day, one of a
      blessed circle of warm-hearted friends. Whatever fears others might have
      as to the disposal to be made of him, Flutters had none for himself. Of
      course he was to be Hazel's faithful little servant from that day forward,
      and it was almost worth while, he thought, to have &ldquo;darkey blood&rdquo; in one's
      veins for the sake of rendering such happy service. Farther than that he
      did not trouble himself, literally taking no thought for the morrow, nor
      for what he should put on when his present habiliments should have found
      their way back to their rightful owner. The &ldquo;Gretchens&rdquo; little company
      made a pretty picture against the blue gray of the bay, and when at last
      there was no more arranging to be done, and all had repeatedly declared
      themselves &ldquo;perfectly comfortable,&rdquo; there was a breathless, momentous
      little pause, as in the moment at a play between the significant and
      abrupt cessation of the orchestra and the rolling back of the curtain. &ldquo;<i>Please</i>
      begin,&rdquo; said Hazel, with a great sigh, as though the intense anticipation
      of that supreme moment was quite too heavy for child-nature to endure, and
      Harry, looking sadly over to the old &ldquo;Jersey,&rdquo; commenced his story.

    <p>
      I am to begin, Hazel, and at the very beginning, too, if I keep my
      promise. Well, this little chapter of my life began with a thought, as
      happens with most everything that is done in this world, and the thought
      was not one I had reason to be very proud of. I suppose all of you know,
      even Flutters, that since the commencement of the Revolution American
      vessels have been cruising about, hoping to capture English vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it chanced about two years ago that the 'Hannah,' a very rich prize,
      was brought into New London. Some of the men who had taken part in her
      capture had sailed out of New London as poor as could be, and here they
      came sailing back again, with a prize in tow rich enough to fill all their
      empty pockets. So it was not strange, perhaps, that the capture of the
      'Hannah' turned a good many young heads, nor that mine turned with the
      rest, and that, as soon as possible, I joined the crew of the 'Venture,' a
      privateer that was being rapidly fitted out for a cruise. At length
      everything was in readiness, and away we sailed with the highest hopes,
      and with our pretty brig so crowded with musketry that when in action she
      looked like a great flame of fire. Well, we were not long at sea before we
      gave chase to an English ship, in appearance as large as ours. We
      exchanged a few shots, then we ran alongside of her, and with one salute
      of all our fire put her to silence, and fortunately, too, without losing a
      single life. I can tell you I was a happy fellow, Hazel (Harry seemed to
      consider Hazel his chief listener), when it fell to my lot to be one of
      the crew who were ordered to man the prize and bring her into port; happy
      I was, and as proud as a turkey-cock; but that state of things did not
      last very long. It was our purpose not to attempt to make a landing until
      we should reach New Bedford; but before we had even cleared the shores of
      Long Island an English ship of war, the 'Belisarius,' of twenty-six guns,
      bore down upon us, and in less than an hour from the time she had sighted
      us, those of our number left on the 'Venture,' and those of us who had
      manned the English brig were all prisoners together and in irons in her
      hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my stars! were you really?&rdquo; exclaimed Flutters, quite unprepared
      for this turn of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Flutters, sixty-five of us, and on our way to the old prison-ship,
      yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many did you say?&rdquo; asked Hazel. She had been thinking she must teach
      Flutters not to say &ldquo;Bless my stars!&rdquo; and things like that, and so her
      attention had wandered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty-five, and in less than five months we were reduced to thirty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did thirty die?&rdquo; she asked, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thirty did die,&rdquo; interrupted Starlight, setting his lips firmly, for
      he knew what he was talking about, &ldquo;and you old English as good as
      murdered them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starlight, don't you dare to speak like that to me,&rdquo; was Hazel's quick
      retort, while the blood flashed hotly into her face. Flutters gazed at her
      with astonishment. Perhaps, thought he, it will not always be an easy
      matter, after all, for even the most faithful of body-servants to please
      such a spirited little mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, Hazel,&rdquo; laughed Harry; &ldquo;I would not stand such incivility
      either, if I were you; but then I must tell you one thing, not all English
      hearts are as kind as yours and Josephine's. If they were, the old
      'Jersey' would not have so sorrowful a tale to tell.&rdquo; Harry paused a
      moment. Starlight and Hazel were feeling a trifle uncomfortable. They
      could not resist the temptation to give each other a little home-thrust
      now and then on the score of their political differences: The result, as a
      rule, was a half-acknowledged admiration for each other's patriotism, and
      an extra touch of mutual consideration in word and manner for the time
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; said Hazel, solemnly, perhaps by way of disposing of the pause
      that seemed to reflect somewhat upon the conduct of herself and Starlight,
      &ldquo;Flutters, <i>what</i> are <i>you?</i>&rdquo; Flutters looked down at his queer
      little Dutch outfit, and then up at Hazel, with a smile, which said as
      plainly as words, &ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; continued Hazel, &ldquo;who do you side with? Are you a stanch little
      Loyalist like me? That is, do you think, as I think, that it is very wrong
      to take up arms against the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters was lying flat in the bottom of the boat now, his dark little
      face propped between the palms of his hands, at a loss to know how to
      answer. He was a trifle embarrassed by the directness of Hazel's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather side with you, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he replied, at last, &ldquo;a sight
      rather; but mulatto boys what has passed most of their time in a circus
      don't know much 'bout those things. I'm going to hear Mr. Harry out, and
      then I'll make up my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Hazel replied, with chilling dignity; &ldquo;please go on,&rdquo; she
      added, turning to Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry hesitated a moment, evidently trying to recall just where he had
      left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in irons on the 'Belisarius,&rdquo;' suggested Josephine, whose
      thoughts, judging from the far-away look in her eyes, had been with the
      poor prisoners all the while rather than with what had been going on about
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there we were! and fortunately with no idea of the suffering in
      store for us. Early the next morning we were led on deck. The 'Belisarius'
      had dropped anchor over yonder (pointing to the New York shore), and two
      boats were coming toward us, for she had signalled the 'Jersey' that she
      had prisoners to transfer. Oh, how our hearts sank within us as the little
      boats that were to carry us came nearer and nearer, and do you wonder,
      children, that we dreaded to board the old craft? Did you ever see a
      drearier-looking object, with never so much as a spar or a mast to remind
      you of the real use of a vessel? Even her lion figure-head had been taken
      away, leaving nothing but an unsightly old hulk, and yet I believe the
      Englishmen who were in charge of her thought the place, wretched as it
      was, too good for us. It seemed we were not even to be treated with the
      consideration due to prisoners of a war with a foreign nation. Having
      risen against the Mother Country, in their eyes we were simply traitors.
      Hopeless and despairing we were rowed over to the old prison, marched up
      the gangway ladder, ordered down the hatchway, and then, with the brutal
      exclamation, 'There, rebels! there is the cage for you,' we found
      ourselves prisoners in the midst of a very wretched company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story was growing pretty painful, and likely to grow still more so,
      provided Harry told them <i>all</i>, as he had promised. Besides, it was
      so terribly real, sitting there aboard of the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; with the old
      &ldquo;Jersey&rdquo; right before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of affording a little relief from what she felt was yet to be told,
      Josephine asked: &ldquo;What was that canvas-covered place there in the stern
      used for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was a shelter put up for the guards on the quarterdeck. Just
      below that, and reaching from the bulkhead of the quarter-deck to the
      forecastle, was what they called the spar-deck, and it was there that we
      were allowed to take such exercise as we could. We used to walk in
      platoons facing the same way, and then all turn at once, so as to make the
      most of the little space. The gun-room, right under the quarter-deck, was
      where I was imprisoned, and it was a trifle more comfortable there, if you
      can use that word in connection with anything on the 'Jersey,' than the
      crowded place between decks where most of the prisoners were herded
      together. I had fortunately been chosen second mate on the English brig
      during the little while that we were masters of it, and to that lucky fact
      I owed my assignment to the gun-room with the other officers. But for
      that, I do not believe I should be here to-day to tell the story. I do not
      see how I could have endured any more and lived. As it was, you know, I
      was very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Hazel, laying her hand affectionately over one of
      Harry's and looking sympathetically into his face; &ldquo;perhaps you had better
      not say very much about that part. Josephine and I cry very easy; don't
      we, Josephine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then please don't, Harry,&rdquo; urged Starlight; &ldquo;I'd rather have a good
      thrashing any time than see a girl cry,&rdquo; recalling one occasion in
      particular, when his own misconduct had moved Hazel to tears, and she had
      refused for the space of one long half hour to be in any-wise comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters had not paid the least attention to this last interruption. He
      was thinking that, after all, the life of a friendless little circus
      performer, sorry and comfortless and forlorn as it was, might be less full
      of hardship than a prisoner's. It was a very grand thing to have one's
      freedom, and he had always had that&mdash;that is, he might at any time
      have run away if he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they give you to eat, Mr. Harry?&rdquo; he asked, by way of comparing
      bills of fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little that was fit to eat, Flutters; but I can tell you exactly if you
      would like to know,&rdquo; and Harry drew from his pocket-book a scrap of folded
      paper. &ldquo;This was our list of supplies. I wrote it down the first week on
      board, and knew it quite by heart all too soon. I think I could repeat it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you try,&rdquo; and Josephine taking the paper from his hand, Harry at
      once began to recite, with the satisfied air of a child that perfectly
      knows its lesson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;1 pound of biscuit, 1 pound of pork, and 1 pint
      of peas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Monday</i>.&mdash;1 pound of biscuit, 1 pint of oatmeal, 2 ounces
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;1 pound of biscuit, 2 pounds beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;1 1/2 pounds of flour and 2 ounces suet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Same as Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Same as Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On <i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Same as Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, how is that?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;any mistakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one,&rdquo; answered Josephine; &ldquo;but really, Harry, is that all you
      received?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Flutters, &ldquo;seems to me that's considerable. Circus folks
      often don't fare no better than that, and don't get things so reg'lar,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Flutters, that is only two-thirds of the allowance of an English
      seaman. However, we would have managed well enough to exist if the things
      had been good in themselves or decently cooked, but all the provisions
      were of so wretched a quality that many a poor 'Jersey' prisoner died from
      starvation through sheer inability to eat them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cooked the things for you?&rdquo; asked Hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever we could manage, Hazel, we cooked them ourselves. Do you see
      that big derrick on the starboard side? Well, that was for taking in
      water, and we each had a scanty allowance of so much and no more each day.
      But, as a rule, we contrived to save a little of it with which to do our
      own cooking, because only the toughest men on board could so much as
      swallow the food prepared by the ship's cook. Under the forecastle, there
      in the bow, hangs a great copper divided in the middle and holding two or
      three hogsheads of water. In one side they cooked the meat, in the other
      the peas and oatmeal&mdash;sometimes, I believe, in salt water, but always
      in water so stale as to be absolutely unfit for use. So five or six of us
      would club together, each contributing our portion of water to the cooking
      supply, and then, by begging a little wood from the cook, now and then,
      and splitting it very carefully and economically with our knives, we could
      manage to keep a fire going that would soon set our little pots boiling.
      It was a great day for us, I remember, when a tangle of driftwood came
      bumping against the ship's side, and we were allowed to haul it on board
      for our fires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been very hard only now and then to have had a little butter
      for the biscuit,&rdquo; remarked Hazel, to whom this particular feature of
      Harry's story appealed most pathetically, so very fond was her own little
      ladyship of the variety and sufficiency of a well-appointed table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the butter was not forthcoming, Hazel; they gave us rancid sweet-oil
      instead, which refused to pass muster with our Yankee palates, so that we
      were able to bestow a double portion upon some poor Frenchmen, who were
      very grateful for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters had changed his mind about the adequacy of the &ldquo;Jersey's&rdquo; bill of
      fare, and was growing not a little indignant over Harry's narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he said, while the color flashed through his dark skin, &ldquo;I
      am siding with the Yankees very fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not blame you very much, Flutters; I never heard of anything like
      it;&rdquo; which was quite a concession for so loyal a little Red-Coat as Hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Harry,&rdquo; asked Josephine, who could scarcely bear to hear of such
      barbarous treatment at the hands of her own kinsmen, &ldquo;do you think King
      George and the English nation, generally, knew about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't, nor do I believe they know it now; but they will some day.
      It was their business to know it, Josephine, and not to leave thousands of
      human beings at the mercy of a few merciless British seamen. Your own
      father would scarcely credit all I could tell him of our treatment, nor
      many another English officer; but it was the clear duty of some of them to
      have looked into the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it was my papa's duty, do you?&rdquo; Hazel asked, bristling up
      a little; she was not going to allow even &ldquo;Cousin Harry&rdquo; to utter a word
      that would seem to reflect upon her father even for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course, I don't mean anything of the kind. If I thought Captain
      Boniface in any way responsible for those horrors, do you think I could be
      on such friendly terms with him? No, Hazel, your father is a true, brave
      man, and no one knows better than I how much he has given up in King
      George's service. It was not his duty to inspect the prison-ships.
      Furnishing supplies for the English troops called for every moment of his
      thought and time, and taxed all his strength and energy; but there are
      some men&mdash;men whom your father knows&mdash;whose names we need not
      mention, who <i>are</i> very culpable in the matter, if you know what that
      means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it means very much to blame,&rdquo; sighed Hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish you would just go on telling about things!&rdquo; urged Flutters,
      beseechingly, for to him the story itself was far more interesting than
      any side remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry remained silent a moment. Since Josephine and Hazel &ldquo;cried very
      easy,&rdquo; he had need to be careful just where he began again. &ldquo;I must not
      forget to tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;something about 'Dame Grant,' as we called
      her, for her visits to the old 'Jersey' constituted almost our greatest
      blessing. She was a fat old woman, who dealt in sugar and tea, pipes and
      combs, needles and pins, and a few other of the necessaries of life. Every
      day or two her little boat would push out from the Brooklyn shore, and,
      rowed by two boys, over she would come to the ship's side. Those of us who
      were fortunate enough to have any money were then allowed to go to the
      foot of the ladder and make some little purchases, obtaining everything&mdash;so
      she always assured us&mdash;'at cost price.' But sometimes I was almost
      sorry that I had a cent to spend. It was so terrible to see the longing in
      the faces of the poor fellows who had no money. I will say this much in
      our favor, however; I think there was hardly a man among us who did not
      share with some one else fully half of whatever he had bought. But
      suddenly the visits came to an end. One morning the little boat put out
      from the shore as usual, but with no one in it save one of the boys who
      used to row it, and he brought us the sad news that the old 'Dame' had
      caught the fever from the hulk of the 'Jersey' and died. After that no one
      else was ever willing to run the risk of contagion for the sake of the
      profits of our little purchases. But one of the happiest experiences that
      ever came to us in those long, dreary days, was to be allowed to become a
      member of the 'Working Party.' It was composed of twenty men, and all the
      prisoners who had any strength left were always eager to join it. It was
      the duty of these men to wash down the upper deck and gangway, to spread
      the awning, and to hoist wood, water, and other supplies on board, from
      the boats that came alongside. Then, in the case of any deaths&mdash;and
      there were often three or four during a single night&mdash;some of the
      party would be assigned the duty of burial, and sent to the shore for that
      purpose, but always closely watched by two or three guards. Strange as it
      may seem, this sad duty was considered the most desirable of all. It meant
      setting ones foot on dear old Mother Earth again, for, at least, a little
      while, and even the mournful work in hand could not quite offset that
      pleasure. Only once was I so fortunate as to be chosen, and so keen was my
      delight in treading the ground again, that I actually took off my shoes
      for the sake of feeling the sand fall away from my feet as we pushed along
      with our sad burden. Now and then it would happen that, notwithstanding
      the watchfulness of the guards, a prisoner would succeed in making his
      escape when sent ashore with one of these interment parties. Near the spot
      where most of the 'Jersey's' prisoners were buried was a comfortable
      homestead belonging to a miller. The men used to call it the 'Old
      Dutchmans, and always looked toward it with a sort of veneration as they
      passed, particularly as they knew that the miller's daughter was deeply
      interested in us. She kept account of all the poor fellows who were
      brought to the shore to be buried, and I think many of us cherished a vain
      sort of hope that deliverance might possibly come through her some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was strange about caring to feel the sand against your feet,&rdquo;
       remarked Starlight; &ldquo;that is the last sort of thing you'd think a fellow
      would ever really care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but if you ever spend even a month on shipboard you'll find
      yourself longing for some of the things that you never so much as gave a
      thought to while you had them. Why, when the men returned to the 'Jersey'
      from the shore they would take back with them as much common turf as they
      could carry, and the little fragments would be greedily sought for and
      inhaled with more pleasure than if they had had the fragrance of a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they pay you in any way for the work? asked flutters, still anxious
      to compare experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in money, of course, Flutters, but we had the privilege of going on
      deck early in the morning, and were allowed to stay till sunset. All the
      other prisoners were ordered down to the foul air between decks two hours
      earlier, there to stay, come what would, for ten wretched hours, with the
      iron gratings of the hatchways firmly fastening them in. Then we were
      granted a full allowance of provisions, such as they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell about when all the 'Venture's crew were at last exchanged excepting
      you and Tom Burnham,&rdquo; suggested Starlight, in a pause that offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't, please,&rdquo; Josephine exclaimed; &ldquo;we all know about that, and it
      was so very dreadful. Besides, it's all right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Flutters, eagerly, sitting bolt upright &ldquo;what's that? <i>I</i>
      don't know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you,&rdquo; Hazel whispered, motioning him closer to her; meanwhile
      Harry pointed out different parts of the ship in answer to certain
      questions of Josephine's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Hazel in a melodramatic whisper, &ldquo;that Cousin Harry
      was taken sick one day very suddenly, and then he had the fever so badly
      that he was carried over to Blackwell's Island to die. But he didn't die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he, really?&rdquo; asked Flutters, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't joke about a thing like this, Flutters. No, he didn't die; but
      while he was getting well very slowly a cartel&mdash;that's a kind of boat&mdash;was
      sent from New London, with some English prisoners on board, to exchange
      for the crew of the 'Venture;' but there were not quite as many English
      prisoners as were needed for an exchange, so they decided they would have
      to leave Cousin Harry and a friend of his, Tom Burnham, who were sick over
      on the island, behind, and as soon afterward as those two poor fellows
      were well enough, back they had to go again to that dreadful old 'Jersey.'
      Wasn't that pretty hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, yes,&rdquo; exclaimed inelegant little Flutters, and Hazel excused the
      word because the occasion seemed to demand something strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there they stayed, Flutters, one whole year longer, till last August,
      when the English had to let all their prisoners go free; but understand,
      Flutters, it was just those <i>few</i> bad men in charge of the 'Jersey'
      who were so cruel. In other places we did not treat our prisoners badly at
      all. Besides, it was very wicked indeed to take arms against the King,
      though, of course, men like Cousin Harry thought they were doing right.&rdquo;
       Hazel, as usual, wound up with a defence of her own loyalist principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the story of Harry's hard prison life was all told, or, rather, as
      much of it as was suited to his audience or was not too heartrending, and
      at once the little party agreed to weigh anchor and sail quite out of
      sight of the dreary old ship before opening the well-filled luncheon
      baskets stowed away in the &ldquo;Gretchen's&rdquo; narrow hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, of course, every one kept on the lookout for the best point to
      come to anchor again; but Flutters was the first to discover a most
      attractive spot on the New York side of the river, where some fine old
      trees grew close to its edge, and already cast their shadows far enough
      out on the water to shade the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; from bow to stern. Thither they
      sailed, quickly dropped anchor, and soon sitting down to cold tongue and
      biscuits, peach jam and sponge cake, endeavored to banish all thoughts of
      prisoners and prison-ships. It was not hard work, for Flutters was funny,
      and Starlight and Hazel actually silly. Indeed, all of them felt a sort of
      reaction from the gloomy, depressing thoughts of the last hour, and, to my
      thinking, a little silliness was perfectly allowable. After a most
      leisurely luncheon, Hazel and Starlight moved to the stern of the boat.
      There was one important matter they had need to discuss confidentially&mdash;the
      return of Flans's clothes. Hazel had not forgotten her promise to surely
      bring them back to Mrs. Van Wyck the next day; and now the next day had
      come, and with no better prospect of any other equipment for Flutters.
      Entirely unconcerned, Flutters, growing drowsy in the noontide stillness
      of the river, had stretched his lithe little body along one of the boat
      cushions and fallen asleep. Josephine, after stowing away the emptied
      baskets, had seated herself again with her back against the mast. Harry
      had moved to a seat by her side, and they were talking together of what
      filled both their hearts&mdash;their anxiety for Captain Boniface; and
      Harry was doing his best to calm Josephine's fears. He spoke most cheerily
      and hopefully, for he honestly did not believe the antagonism against her
      father would amount to so very much; and watching her lovely face brighten
      at his encouraging words, no doubt thought how very beautiful she was. You
      would have thought so too could you have seen her, with her wide-brimmed
      hat pushed far back on her head, and the airiest of little breezes playing
      with the pretty light hair that lay in curling wisps about her forehead.
      Starlight happened to glance toward Josephine just as he and Hazel had
      settled the matter they had in hand, and seemed more impressed with her
      beauty, as she sat there, than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't often find a girl like your sister Josephine,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she's
      lovely herself, and she's lovely to look at. Those two things don't
      generally go together&mdash;in girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Hazel, bristling a little, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that most lovely girls know that they're lovely, and that spoils
      it. The good-natured girls are most always homely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course, you're not homely, Hazel, but then you're not&rdquo;&mdash;a
      long pause&mdash;&ldquo;so very good-natured either;&rdquo; Starlight's love of
      mischief having gotten the better of his discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel gave him one look of indignant condemnation. Then, without a word,
      she moved away, took her seat at Josephine's feet, and for the remainder
      of the afternoon treated Starlight with all the studied coolness offended
      dignity could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o'clock the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; again weighed anchor and steered out
      into the river, homeward bound. It had been arranged that she should touch
      at the foot of Beekman Street, and that Starlight should leave them there,
      so as to stop at Mrs. Van Wyck's and see what could be done about
      Flutters's clothes, or rather Hans's; and from there he would no doubt be
      able to beg a ride out to the Bonifaces'. &ldquo;Good-bye, Hazel,&rdquo; he called
      back, as he bounded on to the little wharf. Hazel vouchsafed no answer.
      Josephine wondered what was up, and so did Harry, but were wise enough not
      to ask any questions. Flutters was not so wise. &ldquo;Miss Hazel, did you hear
      Starlight call good-bye?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not deaf, Flutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn't you answer?&rdquo; with innocent directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my own good reasons. And, Flutters, <i>you</i> must not ever ask <i>me
      why</i> I do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; Flutters answered cheerily, for her word was law
      to him; but Josephine and Harry found it difficult to conceal a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved rather a tedious sail homeward, for the wind that had blown them
      so finely down river in the morning had not been so accommodating as to
      change its direction, and only by dint of much &ldquo;tacking&rdquo; was any headway
      to be made. At last, however, the Boniface homestead came in sight, and in
      the stillness of the twilight the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; was safely moored to her own
      little dock.

      OOD-BYE, Hazel,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Starlight,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Josephine,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Cousin Harry,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Flutters.&rdquo; Quite a medley of good-byes, to be sure, but no more
      than were needed, for Harry and Starlight, once more aboard of the
      &ldquo;Gretchen,&rdquo; were fast gliding out on to the river, and Josephine and Hazel
      and Flutters were being left behind on the wharf. The little prison-ship
      party had had their supper, and now Harry and Starlight were off for
      Paulus Hook; it was high time, too, that they were, since they had already
      been absent a day longer than Harry had planned, and Aunt Frances would
      naturally begin to feel worried. Little Flutters cut a queer figure as he
      stood there on the boating dock in the moonlight. Hans Van Wyck's clothes,
      done up in a snug bundle, were already on their way back to their lawful
      owner, so that he had need to resort once more to the spangles and tinsel
      of his circus costume. By way of making up for insufficient clothing, Mrs.
      Boniface had thrown a shawl about him, one end of which Flutters allowed
      to trail behind, pinning the other close about his throat, with one corner
      thrown over his left shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do something about some clothes for you, Flutters, right away,&rdquo;
       Hazel remarked, as they turned to walk up from the wharf, when, amid the
      darkening shadows of the river, the &ldquo;Gretchen's&rdquo; sail was no longer
      visible. &ldquo;Starlight and I <i>hoped</i> Mrs. Van Wyck would offer to <i>give</i>
      us that suit of Hans's to keep when he stopped to see her this afternoon
      and told her about you, but she did not propose anything of the kind. She
      only said 'it was very inconvenient for Hans not to have them, and she
      hoped we'd manage to get them back to-night.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have managed, haven't you, Miss Hazel?&rdquo; Flutters answered, as if
      the managing were a matter to be proud of; and, mimicking a sort of stage
      stride such as he had often witnessed in tragical circus pantomimes, he
      apparently bestowed far more attention on the sweep of his majestic train
      than on what Hazel was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, I sent them back; what else could I do?&rdquo;&mdash;this last
      rather impatiently, because of Flutters's exasperating unconcern __"but
      how are you going to manage without them is what I'd like to know.&rdquo;..
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters gave Hazel a comical little look. &ldquo;With tights and shawls, I
      s'pose, Miss Hazel, unless the Captain felt like as he could buy some for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hazel decidedly; &ldquo;I am not going to bother father 'bout things
      like that, 'specially now when he's so worried and his life's in danger.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
       This remark brought Flutters to a stand. &ldquo;Is the Captain's life in danger,
      really, Miss Hazel?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is. Josephine said he received a very angry letter the other
      night from some old friends of his. They as much as told him that he must
      go away, and that his life wasn't safe here; and lots of people are going,
      Flutters; people who, like father, have sided with King George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they going, Miss Hazel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To England, most of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will the Captain go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Josephine thinks not. You see he built this house, Flutters, and he
      loves it, and he loves this country, too. Josephine says she believes
      he'll just stay, and try and live the angry feeling down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel,&rdquo;.said Flutters, stopping to gather the trailing shawl over
      one arm, for he was ready now to give his whole mind to the matter in
      hand, &ldquo;it's a very puzzling thing 'bout me. When Mr. Harry was telling
      those sad things of the prison-ship, I thought I was a Whig, and now when
      you are talking 'bout the Captain, it seems as though I was a&mdash;a what
      do you call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Loyalist, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a Loyalist; but I reckon folks what has friends on both sides, had
      better not be anything particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that would be best,&rdquo; Hazel replied, smiling in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel,&rdquo; Flutters said, after a little pause, stopping and looking
      round him somewhat cautiously, as though he feared his question might be
      overheard, &ldquo;did Starlight hear of any 'quiries for me, when he was in the
      city this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel nodded &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in a most mysterious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no danger of their 'quiring round here, do you think?&rdquo; and Hazel
      saw the involuntary little tremble shoot through Flutters's frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Flutters, and we wouldn't give you up if they did. Mrs. Van
      Wyck told Starlight that a forlorn old man, who belonged to the circus,
      stopped at her gate and asked if she'd seen anything of a little mulatto
      boy what had deserted from the troupe, or knowed anything about him, and
      Mrs. Van Wyck said, 'Lor', no!' never dreaming that her very own little
      Hans's clothes were on that same little boy that very moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been good old Bobbin,&rdquo; answered Flutters, fairly chuckling
      over the thought of the entire success of his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he added, after a moment's thoughtful meditation, &ldquo;I've been
      thinking how I might earn the money for my clothes by doing a little
      tumbling for folks round here, only I'm so awfully afraid of being heard
      of by the circus people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion instantly flashed a new scheme through Hazel's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; she said, very slowly and seriously, &ldquo;I've&mdash;thought&mdash;of
      something. Yes, it's the very thing. I'm going to town tomorrow, to see
      Colonel Hamilton about an important matter, and I'll make all the
      'rangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Rangements 'bout the clothes, Miss Hazel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'rangements 'bout everything; but, hush! 'cause nobody else must
      know about it.&rdquo; They had reached the porch where Mrs. Boniface was
      sitting, and Josephine was close behind them, which was the occasion for
      Hazel's &ldquo;Hush&rdquo; and so little Flutters tumbled into bed half an hour later,
      still in ignorance as to what the scheme of his &ldquo;little Mistress&rdquo; might
      be, but with perfect confidence in her ability to make any arrangements
      under the sun.

    <p>
      Joe Ainsworth found his little friend waiting in the sunshine the next
      morning, and, almost without intimation from him, the leaders came to a
      standstill, and Hazel mounted to her seat beside him. &ldquo;Business in town?&rdquo;
       ventured Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Hamilton's, please,&rdquo; all intent on getting comfortably seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, with elevated eyebrows, &ldquo;haven't fixed that matter up
      yet, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I haven't had time to see to it until to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't had time,&rdquo; said Joe, with a significant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't, really. Yesterday I had to go on a sailing party and the
      day before to the circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lands, Miss Hazel! I guess if you had to drive this Albany coach every
      day of your life, week in and week out, and was ever able to take so much
      as a day off for a circus or a sailing party, you would call that having
      lots of time. I would, I can tell ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, perhaps it was because I couldn't do both things, Joe, so I
      chose the sailing party and the circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame you, Miss Hazel. Besides, there can't be anything very
      pleasant for such a loyal little Red-Coat as you to look forward to, in
      calling on our American Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid of any American Colonel,&rdquo; with the air of a grand duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not, Miss Hazel, but I'd have a care to that little tongue
      of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel did not answer. She would not have allowed many people to offer that
      unsolicited advice without some sort of a rejoinder, but she had always a
      most kindly side toward Joe Ainsworth, not entirely accounted for, either,
      by the fact of the free rides.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or other the coach horses kept up a good pace that
      morning, and it was not long before they came to a halt at Hazel's
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Hamilton's law office was in just such another wide-porched double
      house as the Starlight homestead; and, like it, had been vacated by its
      rightful owner during the progress of the war, and so had shared the
      similar fate of being immediately claimed by the English. They were most
      comfortable-looking dwellings, those old colonial homesteads, cheery and
      clean without, in their buff coats of paint lined off with generous bands
      of white, and most hospitable within, with their wide halls running from
      front to back straight through them. It seemed a shame that such a
      homelike place should ever be converted into a mere bevy of offices, but,
      after all, that is but one of many desecrations that follow closely in the
      train of wretched war. The very sight of the house, and the evident misuse
      to which it had been put, stirred Hazel's indignation. She did not know
      who had lived there, but she felt very sorry for them all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced to be her good fortune to find Colonel Alexander Hamilton alone
      in his office, something that did not often happen in the experience of
      that great man, and it was also perhaps her good fortune to be altogether
      unconscious of how truly great he was, else she might not have marched so
      boldly into his presence and told her story in such a frank and fearless
      manner. Yet, who knows, there are big and little women the world over, who
      will stop at nothing, and know neither fear nor shrinking where a friend's
      interests are concerned, especially such a brave, true friend as Starlight
      had always proved himself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Hamilton allowed Hazel to make her statement without interruption,
      save to ask some lawyer-like question now and then, when, in her childish
      eagerness, she had failed to put the facts quite clearly; but,
      notwithstanding her eagerness and the importance of her errand, she took
      time to note that he was &ldquo;a lovely-looking gentleman,&rdquo; and to draw a
      little sigh of regret that so fine a man should not have been a Tory like
      herself. When at last she had cleared her mind of all she had to say, she
      folded her little hands together in her lap, and scanning his handsome
      face closely, waited for his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colonel Hamilton did not answer. With his elbows resting on the arms
      of his office chair he sat for a few seconds gazing down at his hands, the
      fingers of which, with thumb pressing thumb, were clasped in meditative
      fashion before him. Hazel gazed at them too. She thought they were very
      nice hands, and noticed how fine were the linen frills falling over them
      from the circle of the tight-fitting, broadcloth sleeve. She was not at
      all concerned that he did not hasten to reply. She had heard that lawyers
      gave a great deal of thought to &ldquo;things,&rdquo; and she would not hurry him.
      Meanwhile she sought the arms of the chair in which she was sitting as a
      support for her own elbows, and endeavored to lock her own little hands
      together in imitation of his&mdash;so will the feminine mind occupy itself
      with veriest trifles even on the verge of most decisive transactions. But
      the chair-arms were too wide apart and the child-arms too short by far to
      successfully accomplish the imitation. Colonel Hamilton noted the attempt
      and smiled. &ldquo;My little friend,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I'm thinking I am the
      very last man you should have come to about all this. How did you happen
      to appeal to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, sir (Hazel grew a little embarrassed)&mdash;because sir, as I
      told Joe Ainsworth, who drives the Albany coach, <i>you</i> were the
      gentleman who talked the court into deciding the case against Miss Avery
      and in favor of Captain Wadsworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you learn that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have heard my father talk about it; I am his little daughter
      Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, but who may your father be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hugh Boniface, of his Majesty's service,&rdquo; with no little dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the Colonel, with surprise, &ldquo;and what did your father
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not think you were right about it, Colonel Hamilton, but he said
      you were smart enough and handsome enough to make a jury believe anything
      you wanted to.&rdquo; Hazel did not know why the Colonel walked over to the
      window and looked out for a moment, but one might surmise that it was
      simply to conceal a very broad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather doubtful praise, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he said, coming back again,
      &ldquo;but I can tell you one thing, I certainly would not try to make a jury
      believe anything that I did not believe myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Hazel answered warmly, &ldquo;only I thought you could not
      have understood about things. That is the reason I have come to ask you to
      change your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, unfortunately, lawyers' minds when once made up cannot be changed
      very easily, and I am sorry for that, for there is nothing I would rather
      do than be of service to you and your little friend with the pretty name&mdash;what
      do you call him? Starlight? You see, the bother is, I honestly think the
      English have a right to dispose of Miss Avery's house, for they did not
      take it from her nor compel her to leave it. She left it of her own accord,
      now more than two years ago, and entirely unprotected. Now I do not see
      why she should expect to come back to it and turn out its present occupant
      just when she chances to see fit, and the court agrees with me in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But doesn't it seem too bad for a lot of great, strong men to side
      against a lovely lady like Miss Frances Avery?&rdquo; and Hazel gave a very deep
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in one way it does, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; said Colonel Hamilton kindly, &ldquo;and
      the great strong men felt very sorry for her. Unfortunately hers proved to
      be a sort of test case. There are scores of other people who want to come
      back and turn people out of the homes where they have been living, some of
      them for the last six or seven years&mdash;indeed ever since New York fell
      into the hands of the British, and now the court has decided that they
      ought not to be allowed to come, and that under these circumstances,
      'possession is not only nine points of the law,' but ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite understand what you mean about the points of the law,&rdquo;
       said Hazel, frankly; &ldquo;but I do not think about it as you do at all,&rdquo; and,
      in fact, there were many people in those days, and many, too, in these,
      who could make Hazel's words their own, never having been able to
      comprehend how it was that the great lawyer took the stand he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, it is queer,&rdquo; Hazel added, after a moments cogitation, &ldquo;that
      such a Whig as you are, Colonel Hamilton, should have sided with the
      Tories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit more queer, it strikes me,&rdquo; laughed the Colonel, &ldquo;than that a
      stanch little Loyalist like yourself should be pleading so warmly for the
      Whigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if your best friend <i>was</i> a Whig and you felt sorry for him?&rdquo;
       pleaded Hazel, in extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well to be sure, that does put matters in a different light; but truly, I
      do not see what you are going to be able to do about it. If Miss Avery can
      fix matters up with Captain Wadsworth, all well and good, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she can never do that,&rdquo; interrupted Hazel, decidedly. &ldquo;I have seen
      Captain Wadsworth myself. He looks like a kind man, but he isn't. He told
      me to come to you about it; but it seems there's no use going to anybody,
      and I guess Miss Avery and Starlight will just have to live and die over
      at Paulus Hook, and never have a home of their own again&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that Hazel's efforts in behalf of the Starlight
      homestead had apparently met with no success whatever. But she had done
      what she could, <i>all</i> she could, indeed, and there was some comfort
      in that, at least so she thought, as she walked slowly away from Colonel
      Hamilton's office. She paused in a meditative way as she reached the gate.
      &ldquo;Poor little girl,&rdquo; thought the Colonel, who sat watching her from his
      office window, &ldquo;I fancy she had an idea I could go right up to Captain
      Wadsworth's and turn them all out if I wished to, and half believed I
      would do it. As it is, I will speak to the Captain. Perhaps he might be
      able to make some sort of a compromise with Miss Avery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So after all Hazel had at least succeeded in making a friend of the
      Colonel, and of Captain Wadsworth, too, for that matter, and it was not
      altogether improbable that something might result from this state of
      affairs, though she herself little dreamed it. But Hazel had had a double
      purpose in coming into the city that morning, and did not stand there at
      the Colonel's gate because, as the Colonel thought, she was the most
      sorrowful and hopeless of little suppliants, but because she was trying to
      decide just what she had better do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better do next?&rdquo; was the question that always confronted that restless
      and active little woman whenever the completion of any one plan left her
      free to launch upon another. If the little plan had utterly failed, that
      did not matter. It was her life to be busy about something, though the
      something might be of no more importance than the making of a doll's dress
      or the mending of a toy teacup. But now the something to be done was
      important, and having made up her mind what to do, she suddenly started
      off at a brisk little pace that would have surprised the sympathetic
      Colonel could he have seen behind the boxwood hedge that grew close up to
      the gate on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      So great indeed was the change in her bearing, he might with reason have
      suspected her of a little &ldquo;old soldiering&rdquo; while in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel's destination was the Starlight homestead, and the man she wanted to
      see was Sergeant Bellows. She &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; found him seated alone on
      a bench under a tree in the front garden, and this suited her exactly, for
      her interview had need to be a private one. The old Sergeant was cleaning
      some sword-handles, but was glad enough to have his work interrupted by
      the unexpected arrival of his little friend, and made room for her on the
      bench beside him.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; Hazel at once began, without waiting to command
      sufficient breath, &ldquo;that the last time&mdash;I was here&mdash;you asked&mdash;if
      there was anything&mdash;an old sergeant could do for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember, Miss Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think the other men meant what they said when they asked if
      there was anything they could do for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll wager they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, there is something, Sergeant Bellows, a real important
      something, and this is it,&rdquo; and straightway Hazel's voice subsided into
      such a confidential whisper, that even the Sergeant lost a word now and
      then, but he smiled and nodded assent all the while, to Hazel's great
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for us, it is needless to bother our heads with all she told him,
      particularly as we shall see what came of it in the very next chapter.

      HE warm and hazy September days were over. The first of October had come
      in by the calendar, but although its sun had not yet peeped over the
      horizon, there were unmistakable signs in the east which heralded its
      coming. As for Hazel, she was up &ldquo;with the lark,&rdquo; as the saying goes, and
      with good reason, too, for never did any mere little feathered songstress
      have as much in hand as had she for that first day of October, and it <i>all</i>
      depended upon the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wonder, then, with so much on her mind, that the first ray of
      daylight succeeded in shimmering in beneath the long lashes of her eyes,
      first setting their lid a-tremble and then prying them open, so that their
      little owner soon found herself wide awake, and that the eventful day had
      dawned. But what sort of a day was it going to be, that was the
      all-important question. Hazel threw open the shutters of her window. The
      vine that crept along its sill was dripping wet&mdash;could it be raining?
      She stretched out a little brown hand that was all of a tremble with
      excitement, to test if rain were really falling. No, not a drop. It was
      dew on the vines, of course; how foolish not to have thought of that! But
      what made the sky so gray? Was it cloudy? Then she tripped over to the
      clock. Why, so early as that! Then perhaps the sun was not up yet. No,
      come to look again, of course it wasn't, it was just daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having reached this conclusion, Hazel, wisely slipping into a flannel
      wrapper and a pair of bedroom slippers, sat down to wait the rising of
      that very lazy sun, and soon he came. She watched till he was full above
      the horizon, then assuring herself that there were no threatening clouds
      anywhere, crept back into bed, wrapper, slippers, and all, with a mind
      quite at ease, and in just the sort of a mood for the most refreshing of
      little morning naps.
    </p>
    <p>
      One, two, one, two, Company F was marking time preparatory to marching on
      again, and Sergeant Bellows was in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o'clock now, and the sun, for whose dawning Hazel had watched
      so eagerly, was well on his journey, and shining down on the burnished
      flint-locks and scarlet coats of Company F, coats which looked bravely in
      the morning sunlight, notwithstanding many a stain and mark of active
      service. But not for any skirmishing with their enemies were those English
      soldiers under marching orders, for never again were they to wage battle
      with the colonists on American soil. It was now nearly two years since the
      great battle of Yorktown, when the British soldiers had laid down their
      arms, and Lord Cornwallis's sword had been surrendered to General
      Washington, and it would not be long before the whole army, under command
      of Sir Guy Carleton, would go sailing homeward down the harbor, and not a
      British roll-call, nor a soldier answering to it, would be heard anywhere
      in the land. But, somehow or other, notwithstanding all this, Company F,
      of His Majesty's service, did not look very crestfallen, as they stood
      there marking time, until a great overhanging load of hay should leave the
      road clear ahead of them. They had had plenty of time to get used to the
      thought of not having beaten the Yankees; in fact, some of them went so
      far as to openly express their honest admiration for the plucky, desperate
      fashion in which those some poorly equipped Yankees had fought, and did
      not begrudge them their hard-earned victory. Then in seven weeks more they
      were to turn their faces toward home and England; toward England, which
      some of them had not seen for eight long years; toward home, where little
      children had outgrown their childhood, where dear wife faces had grown
      worn with waiting, and where white-haired mothers, wearied with watching,
      had perhaps been laid at rest in the little village churchyards. But, come
      weal or woe, they were soon going home; you could see their faces daily
      grow brighter with the thought, and happening this morning to have a most
      novel entertainment in prospect, what wonder that almost every one wore an
      amused smile, and that every eye twinkled merrily. The clumsy hay-load
      slowly moved out of the way, and then came the order, &ldquo;For'ard, march!&rdquo;
       from Sergeant Bellows, and off they went, with even swing up Broadway,
      turning off at the Albany coach road, and then on out into the country.
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; called Sergeant Bellows at last, and Company F halted right in
      front of Captain Boniface's cottage. It could not have been that they were
      not expected, for Hazel, with beaming smile, stood holding the gate wide
      open, and the men filed in and took their seats in chairs which had
      evidently been placed in rows in the garden for them. The chairs fronted
      the porch, and were grouped in semicircular shape about the wide steps
      leading up to it, at the top of which a curtain (for which two blanket
      shawls had been made to do duty) hung suspended, the cord that held it
      being fastened to the fluted column at either end. That the shawls were of
      widely differing plaids, and at great variance in the matter of color,
      only added to the generally fantastic effect. Without doubt there was
      going to be some sort of a performance, and it was easy now to guess that
      Hazel's &ldquo;'rangements&rdquo; had been in the line of preparation for it, and easy
      now to understand why her little ladyship had been up with the lark, to
      ascertain, if possible, what sort of a day it was going to be. Somehow or
      other I should not in the least wonder if the &ldquo;Old Man of the Weather&rdquo;
       loves to have a little child place implicit trust in him now and then';
      surely he does, if he is at all like some of the rest of us whom you
      little folks call old. At any rate the weather not only favored Hazel's
      project, but seemed just to give itself up to making everything
      comfortable for everybody. The sun saw to it that the old house cast a
      broad square shadow in front of it that was more than large enough to
      cover the space where the men were seated, and the wind saw to it that a
      sufficiently strong little breeze was blowing to temper the early
      afternoon sunshine, and everything conspired to make it a perfect October
      day, a sort of good example, as it were, for the thirty other October days
      that were to follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it was time for that mysterious many-colored curtain to be drawn
      aside, and certain vigorous jerkings of the shawls showed that an attempt
      was being made in that direction. What did it matter to Company F if it
      did not work with all the smoothness to be desired, since it finally
      disclosed to them as fair a little specimen of humanity as the eyes of
      most of them had ever rested upon. In the centre of the stage, or rather
      of that portion of the porch which had been divided off for it, sat
      Hazel's little sister in an old-fashioned high-back chair, her pretty
      slippered feet reaching but a little way over its edge, and her little
      dimpled hands folded in her lap in most complacent fashion. She wore a
      short-waisted, quaint little white dress, barely short enough to show the
      prettily slippered feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all dismayed was little Kate at the sight of so many soldiers
      seated there in such formal array before her. What was every beautiful Red
      Coat but another embodiment of her own dear papa; and not in the least
      alarmed was she by the loud applause which the mere sight of her elicited
      from admiring Company F. She turned her pretty head on one side and then
      on the other, her little face wreathed in smiles, and seeming to say in
      silent baby-fashion, &ldquo;Thank you, gentlemen.&rdquo; Not that she could not talk.
      No, indeed, do not think that for a moment; her baby tongue could move
      with all the insistent chatter of a little English sparrow; but the right
      time had not come yet. As soon as the applause had somewhat abated, Hazel
      herself appeared on the scene, arrayed in a jaunty little riding-habit,
      and with cheeks aglow with excitement, looking prettier, perhaps, than
      ever before in her life. As was to be expected, her appearance was the
      cause for renewed applause; but finally all was quiet, and she stepped
      forward to deliver a little speech which had been carefully thought over.
      She had insisted upon wearing her riding-habit, because, as she had told
      her mother, she was to be a sort of showman. Of course she did not want to
      wear boys' clothes, but the riding-habit seemed sort of a go-between, &ldquo;and
      more like the thing a lady who managed a private circus would wear.&rdquo; So
      Mrs. Boniface consented, and Josephine, in helping Hazel to dress, had
      added an extra touch or two. Her habit was made of gray cloth, with a
      long, full skirt that came within a foot of the ground when Hazel was on
      her pony; but in order that she should be able to move about the platform
      as freely as was necessary, Josephine had caught the skirt up on one side,
      fastening it with two or three brilliant red chrysanthemums, and pinning a
      bunch of the same bright flowers against her waist. On her head she wore a
      black velvet jockey cap which had been sent her by her grandpa from
      England, and which completed the jauntiness of her costume.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Members of Company F,&rdquo; Hazel began, holding her riding-whip in both hands
      before her, &ldquo;I wish to thank you for coming here this afternoon, and to
      tell you that I hope you will feel repaid for your long march out from the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt about that, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; Sergeant Bellows called out, heartily..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Sergeant;&rdquo; but Hazel's manner was somewhat stiff, as though
      she preferred that more formality should be observed. &ldquo;But before
      commencing our performance,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I must ask you to bear in
      mind that it is not an easy thing to get up a regular circus in a private
      family, 'specially at such very short notice. There was no time to teach
      anything new, even to the baby, who learns very easily, and it was just by
      good luck that Prince and Kate and Delta knew some little tricks already.
      As for Flutters, it will not take you long to discover that <i>his</i>
      part of the performance needs no apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel concluded her little speech with a graceful bow, and, turning toward
      Kate, who still sat smiling, announced: &ldquo;I have now the pleasure,
      gentlemen, of introducing to you Miss Kate Boniface, as fine a little
      three-year-old as ever was reared in Westchester County. Miss Kate is
      quite a favorite with the management, being, what we consider, a most
      gifted little lady. She has an original little dance of her own, one
      little song, and one little piece, which she speaks with dramatic effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which s'all I do first, Hazel?&rdquo; asked Kate, in a most audible whisper,
      when she saw that it was time for her to commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the dance of course, child,&rdquo; Hazel answered, forgetting their
      relations of manager and artiste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where's de music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, where was the music? &ldquo;Job,&rdquo; called Hazel, blushing up to the
      roots of her hair with embarrassment, &ldquo;we are waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, Mrs. Manager,&rdquo; came the answer, and a moment later Starlight
      bounded through the green boughs, which had been arranged at the back of
      the scene, violin in hand, and in a costume befitting the clown of the
      performance. His resemblance to the real article was truly quite
      remarkable, for Cousin Harry had taken a great deal of interest in his
      &ldquo;make-up,&rdquo; and the result was a face as white, with cheeks as red and
      eyebrows as high, black, and arching, as were ever attained by Mr. John
      Dreyfus, the English clown of world-renowned reputation. Starlight was
      able to play half-a-dozen tunes on an old violin which had belonged to his
      grandfather, and this formed a most attractive and most important feature
      of the Boniface circus. Otherwise Company F would have been obliged to
      forego little Kate's dancing, than which nothing was ever daintier or
      prettier. But not an inch would her little ladyship move from her chair
      till Starlight had gone through a series of scrapings called &ldquo;tuning up,&rdquo;
       and a merry little dancing tune was well under way. Then she jumped down,
      and running to the front of the platform made the most bewitching of
      conventional little bows, pressing the fingers of both hands to her lips,
      as if generously to throw the sweetest of kisses broadcast. It was very
      evident, then, to the Red Coats&mdash;Miss Hazel to the contrary that
      there had been time enough to teach little Kate one new trick at any rate;
      but the glancing itself was a matter of Kate's own creation, and of a sort
      that baffles description.

      She had never seen any one dance, no one had taught her, but as naturally
      as a little duck takes to the water, had her little feet taken to dancing
      on that evening when, for the first time, Starlight had brought his violin
      to the Bonifaces'. For fully ten minutes, to the great delight of Company
      F, little Kate kept time in a variety of intricate and pretty little
      motions to the rhythm of the old violin a sort of dancing in which slow
      and graceful gestures of dimpled arms and hands played almost as important
      part as the little feet themselves. Indeed, the whole proceeding was a
      deliberate one, owing to an inability on Starlight's part to play any
      faster; but to my thinking &ldquo;The dancing was a matter of Kate's own
      creation;&rdquo; all the prettier for that, and far more becoming to such a
      dignified little maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Company F, it would have liked nothing better than a whole
      half-hour of dancing; but &ldquo;Mrs. Manager&rdquo; wisely protested, and after the
      little song had been rendered with &ldquo;violin accompaniment,&rdquo; and the little
      piece spoken &ldquo;with dramatic effect,&rdquo; Miss Kate Boniface tripped from the
      stage 'midst hearty peals of applause, and Mrs. Manager, as Starlight had
      called Hazel, came once more to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall now have the pleasure of acquainting you, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said,
      with all the superiority of a veritable showman, &ldquo;with my own little
      thoroughbred, one of the most knowing and accomplished of Shetland ponies.
      Mr. Lightfoot, will you have the kindness to bring Miss Gladys into the
      ring?&rdquo; whereupon Starlight, otherwise Mr. Lightfoot, led the pony on to
      the stage, or, I should say, &ldquo;into the ring,&rdquo; as Hazel preferred to regard
      it from a strictly professional point of view. Gladys had been groomed by
      Starlight and Flutters to within an inch of her life, in preparation for
      the occasion, and, indeed, she sorely needed it. The fact was that she had
      been turned out for the last two months owing to an unfortunate gall on
      her back which had refused to heal under the saddle; so, while her
      mistress had been dependent upon Albany coaches for such excursions as she
      wished to take into the city, Miss Gladys had been kicking up her heels
      and running races with herself in the most inviting of clover fields. Only
      yesterday had she been enjoying all this freedom, with burrs in her tail
      and burrs in her mane, and with never so much as a halter, and here she
      was to-day tricked out in blue ribbons, with her coat smoothed down to
      look as silky as possible, and with her four pretty little hoofs oiled up
      to a state of shiny blackness, but without the sign of shoe on any one of
      them. There had been no time, indeed, to have Miss Gladys shod, nor was
      there any need of it, as, after today's performance, back she was to go
      again, for at least another month more, to all the wild dissipation of
      pony life in a clover field. Of course she was astonished at the sight of
      the soldiers, but she had been rehearsing with Starlight and Hazel for a
      whole hour that morning in that sort of &ldquo;box stall&rdquo; which formed the scene
      of the circus, and so, being somewhat familiar with the place, contented
      herself with an occasional pricking-up of her black-pointed ears, which
      only gave her a more spirited look, and, on the whole, was extremely
      becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miss Gladys,&rdquo; said Hazel, when she had-succeeded in getting her
      posed to her liking, &ldquo;I would like you to answer a few questions, and for
      each correct answer you shall have a beautiful lump of white sugar. Mr.
      Lightfoot, have you the sugar ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Manager,&rdquo; answered Starlight, who, in his capacity of clown,
      was endeavoring all the while to keep up a funny sort of byplay, and
      sometimes succeeding; &ldquo;yes, Mrs. Manager, the sugar is all ready. I have
      placed, as you perceive, five lumps upon either extended palm, and would
      like to make this arrangement, that when the pony makes a mistake I may be
      allowed to eat the sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Lightfoot, I am quite agreeable to the arrangement; but,
      if I am not mistaken, the pony thinks you are likely to fare rather
      poorly; how about that, Miss Gladys? Do you intend that Mr. Lightfoot
      shall enjoy more than one of those lumps of sugar?&rdquo; Hazel stood leaning
      against the pony's side, lightly swinging her riding-whip in apparently
      aimless fashion in her left hand, but in answer to her question, Miss
      Gladys shook her pretty head from side to side with as decided an
      assertion in the negative as though she had been able to voice an audible
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! what did I tell you, Mr. Lightfoot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! did Miss Gladys answer? I didn't hear her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you did not hear her. She answered by shaking her head. Ponies
      can't talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! can't Miss Gladys say a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even neigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a <i>very</i> bad pun, Mr. Lightfoot. Don't you think so, Miss
      Gladys?&rdquo; Up and down went the pony's head in ready assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two questions answered with remarkable judgment. Now, two lumps of sugar,
      if you please, Mr. Lightfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gladys eagerly ate the sugar from Hazel's gloved hand (for sugar was one
      of the few creature delights a clover field failed to offer, that is, in
      any form more concrete than the sweetness of a withered clover head), and
      looked as though perfectly willing to continue the process for an almost
      indefinite period. Indeed, for a long time Hazel continued to ply her with
      questions of great moment to Company F, such as, &ldquo;Is Sergeant Bellows the
      best sergeant in his regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is 'Company F' the finest company?&rdquo; and so on, to all of which Miss
      Gladys gave only the most complimentary of answers. Just when this part of
      the performance was coming to a close, Mr. Lightfoot stepped up to the
      pony, and said, in beseeching fashion, &ldquo;Look here, Miss Gladys, on the
      whole, you think I'm a pretty good sort of a fellow, now, don't you?&rdquo; The
      pony looked at Starlight a moment, and then shook her head, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in a
      most decided manner. &ldquo;That's a darling,&rdquo; Starlight exclaimed, swinging
      himself on to Gladys's back, in compliance with an order received from
      Hazel, and with his head resting on her mane and his arms clasped round
      her prettily-arched neck, rode off the stage. The soldiers, of course,
      were at first considerably astonished at the pony's intelligent answers,
      but it did not take most of them long to discover that the shakings of
      Miss Gladys's head were in every case controlled by a touch of Hazel's
      whip. A gentle application of the lash on the right foreleg for yes and
      the same motion on the left one for no. Hazel had tried to conceal this
      little motion as best she could, but it was naturally not an easy matter,
      and when Miss Gladys had been kind enough to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Mr.
      Lightfoot's question, it was only because Hazel's whip was in Starlight's
      hand, and the pony, felt the same familiar sensation upon her left
      foreleg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you wonder how it was that a little country pony was so unusually
      accomplished. Well, to tell the truth, Captain Boniface deserved all the
      credit of it, and Hazel none at all. When Hazel herself was but a week old
      that pony had been bought for her, and, as soon as she was able to take
      notice of anything, Gladys used to be trotted out daily for her
      inspection. And so it happened that while Captain Boniface was waiting for
      his little daughter to grow large enough to ride her, he used to amuse
      himself, and Hazel as well, by endeavoring to teach the pony a few knowing
      tricks. They had required a world of patience, and with none of them had
      he been so successful as with what he called the &ldquo;pony shake,&rdquo; and which
      just had been exhibited to so much advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Miss Hazel's a cute un,&rdquo; said one of the soldiers, in the little
      intermission that followed the exit of the pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cute's no name for it,&rdquo; answered Sergeant Bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She reminds me of my own little girl at home, whom I haven't seen in a
      five-year,&rdquo; said the other, while a little mistiness betrayed itself in
      his soldier eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may mind ye of her,&rdquo; answered the Sergeant, not unkindly, &ldquo;but there
      isn't a child anywhere, I'm thinking, that can hold a candle to Miss
      Hazel.&rdquo; You see Sergeant Bellows was an old bachelor, and without a
      relative in the world whom he cared for, and perhaps that accounted in a
      measure for his adoration of Hazel, though, no doubt, the little daughter
      of the red-haired soldier, who-was probably red-haired too, was just as
      charming in the eyes of her father as Hazel in the eyes of the lonely old
      Sergeant. But further discussion as to comparative merits was brought to
      an end by the reappearance of Starlight on the stage, accompanied by his
      dog, Lord Nelson, who, much against his will, had been dragged aboard of
      the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; that morning, and imported from his kennel at Paulus Hook
      especially for the occasion. Lord Nelson possessed quite a varied set of
      accomplishments, none of them very remarkable, however, and after Lord
      Nelson came Flutters! Flutters in velvet and spangles, Flutters of The
      Great English Circus, and who straightway proceeded to make the eyes of
      Company F open wide with astonishment at his truly wonderful tumbling and
      somersaults. There was no slipping of the little knee-cap to-day. It
      seemed to Flutters quite impossible in the happy life he was leading, that
      knee-caps or anything else that concerned him should ever get much out of
      order again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be easily imagined, the audience would not be satisfied till
      Flutters had favored them with repeated encores, but when the performance
      was at last concluded, there was a call for the entire troupe, and, in
      response, out they came, hand-in-hand, Hazel and Kate, Starlight and
      Flutters; Starlight leading Lord Nelson with the hand that was free, and
      Flutters Miss Gladys. A low, smiling bow from them all&mdash;for even
      Gladys and Lord Nelson were made to give a compulsory nod&mdash;then the
      line retreated a foot or two, the shawl-curtain dropped into place, and
      the entertainment was over. At least so thought Company F, but it was
      mistaken, for no sooner had Hazel and Starlight disappeared behind the
      curtain, than out they came in front of it, and then down among the
      soldiers, Starlight carrying a tray full of glasses filled with the most
      inviting lemonade, and Hazel following with an old-fashioned silver
      cake-basket heaped high with delicious sponge cake of Josephine's best
      manufacture. Then for half-an-hour they had quite a social time of it.
      Captain and Mrs. Boniface, who had watched the performance from two
      comfortable chairs at the rear of Company F, were talking with some of the
      men; Flutters, who, for very good reasons, was still in costume, was the
      centre of another little group; while Kate, from the safe vantage point of
      Josephine's lap, chatted away, to the great entertainment of old Sergeant
      Bellows. Suddenly the Sergeant seemed to recall something important, for
      he jumped up, seized his hat, and began passing it from one to another of
      the men, all of whom had, apparently, come prepared for this feature of
      the entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel was greatly relieved when she saw the hat in active circulation. She
      had felt afraid that the Sergeant had forgotten this part of the
      programme, and did not fancy the idea of having to remind him of it.
      Indeed he had come pretty near forgetting it, so absorbed had he been in
      the charms of little Kate, but as a result of the collection taken up by
      the Sergeant, Hazel found herself in possession of a contribution
      sufficiently generous to purchase a fine little outfit for Flutters. And
      so it came about that Flutters had a &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; and Company F an afternoon
      of what they termed &ldquo;rare good fun.&rdquo;

      ERHAPS you think that is a queer title for a chapter. You would not think
      it queer at all if you had known her, for that is exactly what she was,
      and now and then it is just as well to call people by their right names.
      She was not old, however, in the sense of being wrinkled and white-haired
      and thin. Sometime, when somebody has been very kind to you, and has done
      you a &ldquo;good turn&rdquo; in real reliable fashion, haven't you just rushed up to
      them and exclaimed, &ldquo;You dear old thing,&rdquo; as if any mere young thing would
      be quite incapable of such a deed of loving-kindness? Well, in just the
      sense of being very kind and very reliable, Aunt Frances was old, and in
      no other. To be sure, she was nearing her fiftieth birthday, and there was
      a generous sprinkling of gray hair on her temples, but the gray hair only
      made her face softer and sweeter, and her heart was no older than bonny
      Kate's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Aunt Frances sat knitting in a high-backed rocker on the wide step
      in front of the Van Vleet's door, a step that was made from one great
      unhewn stone, but whose roughnesses had been rounded down by the rains and
      storms of a hundred summers and winters. On the edge of the step, with his
      back against one of the large tubs of hydrangea which flanked the wide
      door-step on either side, sat Harry Avery. He had been silent for a long
      while. He was trying to get his courage up to say something to Aunt
      Frances, something that he knew it would grieve her to hear, and she had
      had so much to bear lately, he could not easily bring himself to it. &ldquo;Aunt
      Frances,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;I know you'll be sorry about it, but I think
      I shall have to go away to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Harry, what do you mean?&rdquo; while the tears gathered as quickly in her
      kind eyes as the clouds of an April shower darken an April sky, &ldquo;and
      besides, where will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home, I suppose,&rdquo; and then it would have been an easy thing for Harry,
      grown fellow that he was, to have mustered a few honest tears on his own
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I am not willing to stay here any longer since you have to pay my
      board. And then you have so little money coming in now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Van Vleets only allow me to pay a very small sum, and, Harry, you
      are such a comfort to me. Starlight's a dear, good boy, but he is not old
      enough for me to burden him with all my troubles as I do you. Tell me
      this, do you want to go home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not want to go home in the least. You know what I mean. I'd give
      a great deal to see father and mother and the youngsters; but there's
      nothing for me to do in New London&mdash;that is, not the sort of work
      that I think I am equal to, and, after leaving it the way I did, I hate to
      go back empty-handed. Then, I'm sure, father would much rather I'd find
      something to do in New York. He believes there is a good deal more of a
      chance for a fellow here.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have heard of nothing, Harry; nothing whatever?&rdquo; Aunt Frances let
      her knitting fall in her lap, and looked straight at Harry as she spoke.
      There was something strange about this direct look from Aunt Frances. It
      seemed to compel the exact truth from everybody, even from Pat, the Van
      Vleets' hired man, who did not ordinarily hesitate in telling an untruth
      if it would make things more comfortable. And so Harry did not even
      succeed in making an evasive reply, as he should like to have done, but
      just answered, very simply and honestly: &ldquo;Yes, Aunt Frances, I did hear of
      something&mdash;a clerkship in a lawyer's office&mdash;but I decided not
      to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decided not to take it? Why, that is the very position you said you would
      like above all others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say that? well, fellows are queer sometimes, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Avery, there is something mysterious about all this. What was the
      name of the lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no matter, Auntie! The whole matter's decided. I made up my mind not
      to take it, and that ends it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Frances was not to be silenced in this fashion. She had a right to
      search this matter out, and search it she would. &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; as if she were
      speaking to some little child, &ldquo;Harry, look me right in the eyes, and tell
      me, was it Colonel Hamilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes but Harry looked off at the river. He had not the sort of courage to
      look Aunt Frances &ldquo;right in the eyes,&rdquo; as she bade him, for if there was a
      man anywhere whom she had a right thoroughly to despise, surely it was
      Colonel Hamilton&mdash;Colonel Hamilton, whose skilful reasoning had
      deprived her of the home that was almost as dear to her as life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the position still open to you?&rdquo; Aunt Frances was now gazing off to
      the river, and with the mark of deep thinking on her face. &ldquo;If it is, you
      must take it. Colonel Hamilton is a great lawyer. It is as fine an opening
      as you could possibly desire. I, for one, have no notion of standing in
      your light, Harry, and you must not do yourself the injustice of standing
      in your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Frances&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't interrupt me, Harry; only listen, like a good boy, and do just
      as I tell you. Take the 'Gretchen' first thing in the morning, go straight
      to Colonel Hamilton's office, and apply for the place. Tell him all about
      yourself, and answer every question he may ask in the most straightforward
      manner, but do not volunteer the information that you are a relative of
      mine. It would not do you any good and it might do harm&mdash;that is, it
      might incline the Colonel less kindly toward you. Unless some one has
      gotten ahead of you, you will secure the place, I am sure of it, and no
      one will be more glad for you than just my very self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Frances,&rdquo; said Harry, watching the needles that were again flashing
      in the afternoon sunlight, &ldquo;you are the dearest old trump that ever
      knitted stockings for a fool of a fellow like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought this stocking was really to grace a fool's leg&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Aunt Frances feigned great seriousness&mdash;&ldquo;not another stitch would I
      take; but, begging your pardon, you would have been a fool indeed if you
      had not told me about all this, although I perfectly understand that your
      motives for not telling me were anything but foolish. No, Harry; somehow I
      am sure it is only providential that you should have heard of this place.
      Promise to try for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; and Harry's lightened heart unconsciously betrayed itself in
      voice and look. He had wanted the situation, oh! so much, more than he
      would admit even to himself, but he had decided he must forego any attempt
      to secure it. It would be, he thought, at too great a cost to Aunt
      Frances's feelings, and he simply must not ask it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Harry,&rdquo; she said, shading her eyes with one hand, &ldquo;isn't that the
      Boniface boat about a mile to the left of the point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Harry answered, merely glancing in that direction; &ldquo;but tell
      me one thing before I go down to the wharf: tell me, Aunt Frances, do you
      think Colonel Hamilton an unprincipled man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unprincipled! Why, Harry, do you suppose for a single moment that I would
      urge you to seek a situation under him if I thought that? No, I believe
      that he honestly felt that the English ought to be allowed to keep
      possession of the houses that we had abandoned, and so perhaps it was only
      natural that when Captain Wadsworth took his case to him, he should bring
      all his eloquence, which is very great, to bear on that side of the
      question. Nevertheless I confess, as that eloquence cost me my home, I
      cannot but feel pretty sore about it, and would go a long way out of my
      way to avoid meeting him, brave officer and brilliant lawyer as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry felt considerably relieved by this assertion, and strolled down to
      the boat-landing with even more admiration for &ldquo;darling old Aunt Frances&rdquo;
       than he had ever felt before. It was so unusual, he thought, to find a
      woman who could reason fairly, independent of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Frances was not quite so 'independent of her heart,' as Harry put
      it, as Harry and the rest of the world thought, and for the very good
      reason that her heart was as big as herself. And so when Harry had left
      her, what did she do but lay aside her knitting, go straight up to her own
      little room in one of the gable ends of the house, shut the door of it,
      and then, sitting down in a low little rocking-chair, bury her face in her
      hands and cry. It had not been by any means an easy thing for her to urge
      Harry to seek a position under a man who had wrought her so much harm, but
      it had been her plain duty, at whatever cost to herself, and she had done
      it. Now when Aunt Frances cried, it was because that great heart of hers
      had had one little ache crowded upon another little ache till it could
      bear no more, and then the hot tears <i>must</i> (there was no choice at
      all in the matter) be allowed to flow for a while and ease it. But for all
      this, do not think for a moment that Aunt Frances was an unhappy sort of
      person. Each little experience of her life and of the lives of others had
      a very deep significance for her, because she believed with all her heart
      that God watches over every life and guides it, and no one who believes
      that can ever be unhappy long at a time; life is to them too beautiful and
      earnest. But this was the way of it with Aunt Frances: she had a great
      capacity for loving, if you understand what that means, but she did not
      have as much of a chance to spend that love as many another, who had not
      half as much to spend. She would always be Miss Frances Avery, she felt
      sure of that; yet what a tender, loving wife she could have made for
      somebody! She should never have any one nearer to her than Harry and
      Starlight (bless their hearts!) but oh, what a mother she might have been
      with her great passionate love for little children! And so it was that
      Aunt Frances trod the round of the life God had sent her, because He had
      sent it, contentedly and happily, and yet it would happen now and then
      that some thoughtless word or deed would almost unaccountably set one
      little spot to aching, and something else would set another, till her
      heart was all one great ache, and the pent-up tears must come. Aunt
      Frances could always tell perfectly well when there was need to retreat to
      the little room in the gable, the little room that had been hers now, for
      the two years since she had fled from her own home across the river; and
      while she sat there on the step with Harry she knew well enough what she
      should do the moment he was gone. It was not that she did not mean every
      word she said to him; it was only that somehow that little talk had
      overcharged the brave heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward, when the Boniface's boat had touched at the dock and all the
      Van Vleets were flocking out of doors to welcome them, Aunt Frances was in
      their midst, with the sunshine of her presence all the brighter for the
      storm of troubled feelings that had just swept over it, but Josephine
      Boniface thought she saw just the faintest trace of recent tears in Aunt
      Frances's eyes as she stooped to kiss her. &ldquo;Dear old Aunt Frances,&rdquo; she
      whispered, as she put her arm about her neck, &ldquo;I would give all the world
      ever to be such a blessed ministering angel as you are to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Josephine, darling, what foolishness,&rdquo; whispered Aunt Frances; but
      it needed only those few sweet words to banish even the trace of tears,
      and to make her thoroughly light-hearted once again.

    <p>
      HE Van Vleet family was composed of seven individuals. There were Father
      and Mother Van Vleet, who had been married while both were in their teens,
      and their five children, Gretchen, Heide, Francesca, Pauline, and Hans Van
      Vleet, who had been born in the order named in the seven years immediately
      succeeding their parents' marriage. So, in point of fact, now that they
      were grown, there was scarcely any perceptible difference between this
      comfortable Dutch couple and their children, save that the children were
      taller, which made it seem more of a joke that they should actually belong
      to a father and mother who looked almost as young themselves. All this
      combined to make them a united and congenial family, and they lived in a
      comfortable old Dutch homestead and were very well-to-do, owing to the
      well-tilled acres that stretched down to the river in front of them and
      back to the ridge of the Jersey Flats behind. But there was one minor
      chord in the otherwise cheery harmony of the Van Vleet household. Pauline,
      the youngest sister, now about twenty-two, was not &ldquo;quite bright,&rdquo; but she
      was serene and, as a rule, perfectly happy, which is a deal more than can
      be said of many people, be they ever so bright. There were two reasons for
      this serenity of Pauline's: her own naturally placid temperament and the
      tender care with which all the others watched over her. But one thing must
      be confessed, they were not a patriotic family, and the blood in their
      veins coursed somewhat sluggishly. They had rather hoped that the
      colonists would win in the war of the Revolution, thinking, no doubt, it
      would be more to their interest, yet it had never once occurred to Hans or
      his father to shoulder a flintlock in place of a hoe and go and help them.
      They were a good, narrow, stay-at-home family, with their thoughts moving
      in one and the same channel, and with interests bounded by their own
      acres, their own experiences, and those of their nearest neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one delightful feature about their neutrality: they could be
      the best of friends alike with Whigs and Royalists, and were able to
      invite the Bonifaces to a tea party just as cordially as they could offer
      the shelter of their home to poor fugitive Aunt Frances. And a few days
      before they had invited them. Kind old Mrs. Van Vleet, knowing that these
      were very lonely days at best for Captain Boniface's family, determined to
      do all that lay in her power to brighten them, and so a formal invitation,
      written by Heide in the stiffest of little cramped hands, was sent them.
      Mrs. Boniface had accepted most gladly. It meant so much to have this
      evidence of true friendship at a time when many old friends were looking
      askance and turning a cold shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now Saturday afternoon had come, the first Saturday in October, and
      the Boniface boat was tacking across the river in the teeth of a bracing
      west wind. They were all there, the entire household, from Captain
      Boniface, at the helm, to Flutters, in his well-fitting corduroys, seated
      astride of the bow. Flutters loved to be in the &ldquo;front of things&rdquo;
       generally, but in the present instance it frequently became necessary for
      him to draw his knees quickly up to his chin, being quite too newly shod
      to run the risk of contact with the salt water white caps that now and
      then thumped plumply against the bow. Harry Avery was at the wharf long
      before the little boat touched it, and stood whittling a brier-wood stick
      as he waited, and dreaming the while the happiest dreams about the future
      that might open up before him if he should secure that position with
      Colonel Hamilton. Somehow or other Harry felt almost certain he could get
      ahead in the world if it would only give him any sort of a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo there, Harry! a penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; called Captain Boniface,
      bringing his boat about and alongside of the wharf in true sailor fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry jumped to his feet and blushed like a school-girl, as if he half
      feared the thought of his heart could be read by them all. &ldquo;It is
      fortunate that I am not bound to tell them,&rdquo; he answered, catching the
      rope which the Captain had thrown him, and securing it to a staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not bound, of course, but thoughts ought to be of a pretty high order
      that make you unmindful of the coming of the 'Grayling' and the
      Bonifaces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry was glad to find the Captain in this lighter vein, for life had been
      too serious and complicated a matter lately for him often to forget its
      seriousness. As for Mrs. Boniface, she had been both surprised and
      delighted when she found her husband willing to accept the Van Vleets'
      invitation, for lately it had been quite impossible to get him to take any
      interest in anything of the sort, and she feared a kind but absolute
      refusal. But no sooner had the &ldquo;Grayling&rdquo; cleared her dock than the
      Captain seemed to regain his wonted good spirits, and to leave all his
      heavy-heartedness behind, and glad indeed was his little family to see him
      in a cheery mood once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Bonifaces commenced to ascend the beautiful grass-grown
      meadow, which swept down to the water's edge, out came all the Van Vleets
      to meet them and escort them up to the house; and it was a remarkable old
      dwelling, unlike anything one would see nowadays, if it were not that two
      or three such homesteads have chanced to survive the ravages of a century,
      by grace of having once been dignified as &ldquo;Washington's Headquarters.&rdquo;

      It was a double two-story house, or rather three-story, if you count the
      little rooms in the gables. It was built of stone, coated with a rough
      sort of plaster, and faced the river; its large square stoop, flanked with
      its two benches, being protected by the overhanging eaves of the roof
      itself. The front door, seldom opened, was ornamented with a huge brass
      knocker in the shape of a lion's head, and was daily burnished with as
      much thoroughness as though in constant use. Indeed, it must be confessed
      that in front everything was severe and prim and painfully stiff, but
      fortunately at the side things were different. Indeed, the house, in its
      two entirely different aspects, resembled an old army officer, always
      stern and arbitrary with his men for the sake of discipline, but 'another
      fellow altogether' when off duty and in the company of his brother
      officers. At the side it was as though you surprised it in undress
      uniform. In the first place, there was always, in the season, a great
      profusion of flowers; not, however, in conventional flower beds, but
      parading their blaze of color from painted tubs, mounted here and there on
      the table-like tops of old tree stumps, which had evidently survived the
      first clearing of the land. Fortunately for general effectiveness, these
      tubs were not filled with a promiscuous assortment of plants, but each
      held the luxurious growth of some single variety&mdash;here a hydrangea,
      with its wealth of heavy-headed blooms, fairly concealing its leaves;
      there a great cluster of peonies or brilliant scarlet geraniums. As might
      be expected on the first Saturday of October, many of these plants bore
      only a few tardy blossoms, and some of them had evidently lost all heart
      with the first intimation of frost; but in the centre of the old-fashioned
      grass plot was a contrivance that from June well into November presented a
      remarkable blaze of color, varying with every month, and always beautiful.
      This contrivance, called by the Van Vleets &ldquo;The flower fountain,&rdquo; was
      composed of a series of five circular shelves, each shelf a little smaller
      in circumference than the one below it, and terminating, at the height of
      about five feet from the ground, in a round flat top. These shelves were
      constantly crowded with pots of plants in full bloom. Indeed, Hans kept a
      sort of nursery for no other reason than to supply the fountain, and the
      moment a plant took it into its head to bloom no longer, or only in a
      spiritless way, back it was marched to the nursery, and another took its
      place. What a fine thing it would be if some of the little folk too, who
      are not blooming out into just the sort of grown folk we could wish, might
      simply be remanded to the nursery, there to be restarted, after the manner
      of Hans's plants, and perhaps coaxed into a more satisfying growth than
      they now, alas! give promise of! But if it had not been for this flower
      fountain, who knows but Hans might have gone to the war? You can see how
      it would not be an easy thing for a placid, kind-hearted Dutchman, who
      loved the training and slipping and potting of plants above everything
      else in the world, to turn his pruning-knife into a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the tea-party this fountain was ablaze with
      chrysanthemums, varying in color from the darkest red to the palest pink,
      and from orange to pure white. The plants of one shelf hid the pots of the
      shelf above it, and the lowest shelf of all was sunk so low in the ground
      as to be concealed by the grass. But what gave this side of the house the
      &ldquo;homiest&rdquo; look of all was the row of shining milk tins ranged in a row on
      a low bench, and tilted against the wall. Then, just beyond them, the
      kitchen door opened, and such a kitchen! with tables and dresser and every
      wooden thing in it scoured to immaculate whiteness, and with white sand
      daily sifted upon the floor in most remarkable patterns. In this kitchen
      the Van Vleets not only ate, but lived, and so it possessed that
      undefinable charm which sometimes belongs to the living-room of a family,
      and never to any other. In preparation for the Bonifaces' coming, large,
      high-backed Dutch rockers had been ranged round this kitchen door, and
      here the little party seated themselves under the uncertain shade of a
      half-leafless oak-tree, that allowed the warm sunshine to slant gratefully
      down upon them, and where they could enjoy the flower fountain to the
      full. The Misses Van Vleet were busy within doors attending to the
      preparations for supper&mdash;that is, with the exception of Pauline, who
      was always at liberty to do pretty much as she chose; and what she had
      chosen to do this afternoon was this: After the Bonifaces had come up from
      their boat she had noticed somebody still moving about in it, so down she
      went to investigate. Then, when she reached a point near enough to be
      quite satisfactory to her ladyship, she sat herself down on the low,
      straight limb of a stunted apple-tree, and waited.

      HE somebody moving about in the &ldquo;Grayling&rdquo; was Flutters. He was arranging
      boat cushions, folding up wraps and shawls, and putting things generally
      to rights. Dear little fellow! No one had told him he ought to do this; he
      did it quite by grace of his own thoughtful intuition, and he found so
      many little things all the while to do, and did them all so gladly, that
      he wondered a trifle proudly how the Bonifaces had ever managed without
      him, and the Bonifaces wondered too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, when Flutters had gotten everything into literally ship-shape
      condition, and quite to his mind, off he started up the bank, bending far
      over, as one must when one attempts to scale a steep place rapidly. So it
      chanced that he did not see Miss Pauline at all until she spoke to him,
      and he was himself directly under the scant shadow of the apple-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, sir,&rdquo; said Pauline, in an authoritative way, which brought
      Flutters, surprised and breathless, to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she added in a moment, pointing to a rock covered with gray
      moss, and confronting the limb where she was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters mechanically obeyed. He knew she must be one of the family, and
      as he had met many queer people in his day, did not marvel that here was
      somebody, to all appearances, a little queerer than the rest. She looked
      very pretty balanced there on the low limb of the tree, in her
      full-skirted gray gown, and with the western sunlight shining on her back
      and turning her curling yellow hair into a sort of halo about her
      forehead. Flutters sat and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like my looks?&rdquo; she asked complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Flutters, astonished; &ldquo;you are a Miss Van Vleet, aren't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm Miss Pauline Van Vleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; Flutters remarked, just by way of saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best <i>never</i> to say what you think,&rdquo; said Miss Pauline
      solemnly. &ldquo;Folks get themselves into trouble that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters felt inclined to suggest that people would be very stupid and
      uninteresting if they did not sometimes say what they thought, but wisely
      concluded it was better not to start an argument with this peculiar young
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a new Boniface?&rdquo; asked Pauline, scanning him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; laughed Flutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not ask what you were exactly; are you a new Boniface at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a queer question, thought Flutters, and then went to work to answer
      it to the best of his ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not a Boniface at all, but I am new in this part of the country.
      I used to live in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pauline seemed very much amused at this, saying it over to herself
      two or three times. &ldquo;Did your father use to call you Flutters?&rdquo; she asked
      presently, looking at him searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, the color rushing into his brown face, for no one had
      asked him that direct question before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called me&mdash;he called me&mdash;but that is one of the things I do
      not tell to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Flutters, child, you will tell me, just me,&rdquo; and Pauline looked at
      him with a look as pathetic as though she were pleading for her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't, Miss Pauline, really I can't;&rdquo; whereupon Miss Pauline buried
      her face in her two pretty hands, and began to cry like a child.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you're not crying for that, surely?&rdquo; Flutters asked, never more
      astonished in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just for that&mdash;just for that&mdash;and I'll cry harder and
      harder until you tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, all the Van Vleets were so in the habit of humoring this
      poor sister of theirs, and never crossing her will if it could possibly be
      helped, that this refusal on Flutters's part truly seemed to her most
      preposterous, and she was shedding actual tears. Flutters saw one or two
      of them find their way through her fingers, and, like other heroes,
      relented at the sight; besides, what else was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, I will tell you,&rdquo; he said softly; &ldquo;my real name is
      Arthur Wainwright;&rdquo; and the mere sound of it, whispered though it was,
      made him start. It was so long now since he had heard it on the lips of
      any one! Indeed, it did not seem as though it belonged to him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a pretty name,&rdquo; replied Pauline, beginning to be comforted and to
      dry her tears; &ldquo;now tell me <i>all</i> about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't,&rdquo; replied Flutters, pained at the need of refusing; &ldquo;I <i>must</i>
      keep it a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can keep it a secret all the same,&rdquo; said Pauline sadly, and with that
      insight into her own deficiencies which sometimes flashes across a
      distraught mind, &ldquo;for, you see, I cannot remember it long enough to tell
      it to anybody, so tell me, please&mdash;please tell me; nothing makes
      Pauline so happy as a real true story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entreaty in her voice was too much for Flutters, and he dreaded more
      than he could express a fresh outburst of tears, therefore he decided to
      run the risk, and try if he could to make Miss Pauline happy, especially
      as he thought it highly probable that what she said was true, and that she
      really would not remember anything long enough to repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not much about me,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but I will tell you all there
      is.&rdquo; It did not occur to his honest little soul that any story he might
      have chosen to concoct would have answered just as well for Miss Pauline.
      He neither added to nor in any way digressed from the exact truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was an Englishman,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and he lived for a while in
      India, for he had some business there, and my mother was a colored woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; said Pauline, &ldquo;I would not like a father of one sort and a
      mother of another; which kind did you like best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not remember my mother at all, but my father said she was beautiful
      and a good woman, but not just what people call a lady. She died when I
      was two years old, and then my father took me to England, and then after a
      while he married a real lady, a white English lady like himself, and they
      had some lovely white children; but the English mother never liked me. I
      think she couldn't somehow, Miss Pauline&rdquo;&mdash;he seemed to reason as
      though he were afraid of blaming anybody&mdash;&ldquo;and I thought I was in the
      way&mdash;in the way even of my father; and so one day I ran off and
      joined a circus that was coming to America. But I did not care for the
      circus very much, and so Job Starlight and Miss Hazel helped me to run
      away from that, and now I'm Miss Hazel's body servant, and the Bonifaces
      seem to like me, and I never was so happy in all my life before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a very nice story, too nice for a secret. Why don't you tell it
      'round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because I don't want my father ever to hear of me, for then he might
      send for me, and I want to stay with the Bonifaces always. You won't tell,
      will you, Miss Pauline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would if I could,&rdquo; she answered, with a spirit of mischief, &ldquo;but you
      can't tell things if your head's like a sieve, and lets everything
      through, can you? Now is there nothing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there isn't,&rdquo; Flutters answered, a little shortly, indignant at her
      answer. It hardly paid, he thought, to be kind to a young lady who acted
      like that. But fortunately Pauline did not notice the curtness of his
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give me your hand, Flutters, and we'll go up to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you. Boys as big as I am don't need to be helped along by the
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;give&mdash;me&mdash;your&mdash;hand or
      I'll&mdash;I'll cry harder than before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, dear, dear,&rdquo; thought Flutters, &ldquo;is there no way out of this?&rdquo;
       and he looked furtively down the bank toward the boat, as though he
      seriously contemplated taking to his heels and launching out upon the
      river as the only adequate means of escape. But suddenly Miss Pauline put
      one hand to her ear, and Flutters, looking in the direction in which she
      pointed with the other, saw that some one up at the house was ringing a
      bell, and at the same time too heard its tinkling, which Pauline's keen
      hearing had been quick to detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; she said, gazing down at him with the most satisfied smile
      imaginable, &ldquo;that means supper. Come on up;&rdquo; then away she flew toward the
      house, leaving Flutters to follow at a reasonable gait, and profoundly
      thankful to be relieved from the alternative of either being led by the
      hand or taking refuge in ignominious flight.

      O one had noticed the <i>tête-a-tête</i> which Flutters and Miss Pauline
      had been holding at a distance, only when Flutters came on the scene Hazel
      asked what had kept him so long, and he made some evasive reply. He hoped
      no one would ever know of the encounter. In the first place, because he
      foolishly felt he had somehow been gotten the best of, and, in the second
      place, because Miss Pauline had heard what he had fully intended no one of
      his new friends ever should hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a member of the Van Vleet household, Starlight naturally felt a share
      in the responsibility of entertaining, and, taking Flutters under his
      wing, presented him to one and another of the family as &ldquo;Flutters, the new
      boy over at the Bonifaces'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; said Miss Pauline when in turn Flutters was introduced to
      her; &ldquo;he's not a new Boniface at all; I know better than that, don't I,
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what shall, what shall I say?&rdquo; groaned Flutters inwardly; but
      Starlight dragged him away with the explanation that the young lady was
      not right in her mind, and so there was no necessity of saying anything.

    </h5>
    <p>
      It proved a most inviting table that the Van Vleets had spread for their
      Royalist friends. Two deep apple pies graced either end of it; a great
      platter of doughnuts or &ldquo;oly keoks,&rdquo; as the Dutch has it, had been placed
      in the centre, towered above, on one side, by a long-stemmed glass dish of
      preserved peaches, and, on the other side, by a similar dish of preserved
      pears. Frau Van Vleet presided over a large Delft teapot ornamented, as
      Washington Irving describes a similar pot, &ldquo;with paintings of fat little
      Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses, tending pigs, with boats sailing in the
      air and houses built in the clouds, and sundry other ingenious Dutch
      fantasies.&rdquo; As the kitchen table was not of the extension variety, and so
      not capable of accommodating the entire party, places had to be set for
      Hans, Harry Avery, and two of the Van Vleet sisters at a separate table in
      one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of Frau Van Vleet's customary seat at the larger table was the
      great open fireplace, which was roomy enough to accommodate two people on
      each of the benches lining either side of it. On a crane, suspended over
      the crackling logs, hung a huge copper tea-kettle, from which Harry, since
      he had been staying with the Van Vleets, had taken upon himself the duty
      of refilling the Delft teapot whenever needed during the progress of a
      meal, and indeed had completely won the heart of the kind old Frau, as
      soon as he had come among them, by his eagerness to serve her in every
      possible way. To-night he was kept busy, for both Van Vleets and Bonifaces
      were famous tea-drinkers, only they managed the matter differently in
      those days. The lump of sugar was placed beside the cup, not in it, and
      people nibbled and sipped alternately. The principal hot dish of the
      tea-party was broiled ham, and, done to a turn and deliciously savory, was
      delicate enough to tempt almost any appetite. Then there were two blue
      china plates heaped with biscuits, every one of which, from very
      lightness, had risen and risen, till top and bottom were a long way apart;
      but notwithstanding these generous proportions, the two blue plates had
      been emptied and replenished more than once before all were satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pauline's seat at the table had been placed at quite a distance from
      Flutters, but, without daring often to look in her direction, Flutters
      felt with considerable nervousness that her gaze was riveted almost
      constantly upon him. Finally, to his astonishment, and at a time when
      there had been a pause of several seconds, she announced very calmly,
      &ldquo;Wainwright's a nice little boy. I like his looks and he likes mine; don't
      you, Wainwright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters kept his eyes on his plate, and in his embarrassment swallowed
      two or three morsels of ham that were far too large in far too rapid
      succession. &ldquo;She'll tell it all, if they only give her time,&rdquo; he thought
      savagely, but he did not intend to make any reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She means you, Flutters,&rdquo; whispered Miss Heide, who sat next to him. &ldquo;You
      had better answer her, 'that you do like her looks.' We never differ with
      her. It is just a fancy of hers, this calling you Wainwright; but where
      could she ever have heard the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it only were a fancy,&rdquo; thought Flutters, while Miss Pauline sat, with
      her teacup poised in her pretty hand, waiting his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like your looks,&rdquo; said Flutters in a compulsory sort of way that
      made every one smile, while the color surged over his brown face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; she answered complacently, &ldquo;and I wouldn't mind at all
      about your mother being colored, because that's how you come by your dark
      skin, and your dark skin is the beauty of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pauline was growing rather personal, and it certainly did look as
      though she knew what she was talking about; but fortunately no one
      attached any weight to what she said, and as she seemed inclined to follow
      up a line of thought which must at least be annoying to poor little
      Flutters, the sister who sat nearest her tried quietly to divert her,
      while another started a new topic of general conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the meal was over, and Flutters was glad; nor was he the only one
      that felt relieved. Captain Boniface had finished his supper sometime
      before the others, and for the last ten minutes had been nervously taking
      up his tumbler and setting it down, and shifting his position in his
      chair, as though unable longer to keep his long legs penned under the
      narrow table. Mrs. Boniface had noticed it and wondered at it, and felt
      thankful when Frau Van Vleet pushed back her chair and so gave the signal
      to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, what can the matter be?&rdquo; screeched a great green parrot hanging
      in its cage by the doorway, and who had apparently been roused from deep
      reverie by the scraping of the chairs on the sanded floor. Mrs. Boniface
      gave a start of surprise, for the parrot had given exact expression to her
      own thoughts. She was watching her husband closely, and knew by experience
      that something was troubling him, and yet he had been so gay that very
      afternoon. &ldquo;I believe it was all assumed,&rdquo; she thought to herself, and the
      more she thought, the more assured she felt that she was right. Oh, how
      she longed to steal over to him and question him; but no, that would not
      do. Frau Van Vleet had arranged two chairs side by side for a neighborly
      chat, and there was no way out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the supper was over, the Misses Van Vleet's domestic duties were
      over too, the clearing of the table being left to &ldquo;Rhuna,&rdquo; an old crone of
      a negro servant, who had been with them many years. Then, as was their
      wont, the young ladies resorted each to her particular rush- bottomed
      chair and the knitting of her own woollen stockings, while Josephine, with
      little Kate upon her lap, endeavored to make her exhibit some of her
      pretty accomplishments for their general amusement. Hazel, Starlight, and
      Flutters had accompanied Hans Van Vleet and his father off to the barn for
      the milking, while Captain Boniface and Harry, in close conversation,
      walked off toward the river. Harry had joined the Captain at a signal that
      he would like to speak to him, but he had not noticed his altered manner,
      and under the impression that he was in the best of spirits, was
      altogether unprepared for what he was about to hear.
    </p>
    <p>

      href="images/8121.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; began the Captain seriously, &ldquo;I have received the most
      distressing news within the last twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it, sir,&rdquo; with evident surprise; &ldquo;I thought matters were
      looking brighter for you every day. I have reason to know that at least
      two of the signers of that insulting note you received are heartily
      ashamed of their behavior, and are actually on the look-out to atone for
      it in some fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I hear, and I am very grateful; but all that good news is offset by
      other news which has reached me this morning: some Tory friends of ours in
      South Carolina have just been brutally murdered by the Whigs,&rdquo; and then
      the Captain excitedly narrated all the sad details of the tragedy so far
      as he knew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry listened attentively. &ldquo;It is certainly very dreadful,&rdquo; he said at
      last sadly; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added with characteristic honesty, &ldquo;I have heard of
      some of the doings of those South Carolina Tories, and many of them,
      though possibly your friends were not among them, deserved harsh
      treatment, Captain Boniface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said the Captain abruptly, as though too busy with his own
      thoughts to have heard what was said, &ldquo;tell me frankly, do you suppose
      this community will ever again treat me as a decent member of society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain Boniface, I do, and I have something with me this moment
      that points that way,&rdquo; and he handed him an unsealed envelope. It was
      addressed to the Captain, and he found it to contain a card of invitation,
      which read as follows: &ldquo;The Executive Committee of the Assembly
      respectfully informs the ladies and gentlemen of New York that a dance
      will be given on Monday next at the City Assembly Rooms, to begin
      precisely at five o'clock. Price of tickets, six shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they ask us to the Assembly, do they?&rdquo; said the Captain, glancing over
      it with evident surprise. &ldquo;They have contrived to leave us very little
      heart for dancing,&rdquo; he added sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will go,&rdquo; urged Harry; &ldquo;that invitation means even more than you
      suspect. It means, I think, that there is an organized effort on foot to
      fully reinstate you, and some other Tories as well, whom they have treated
      so uncivilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think it implies all that?&rdquo; said the Captain, smiling
      incredulously at his enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm sure it does, and you will go and take Mrs. Boniface and Miss
      Josephine; promise me, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain did not reply at once, and Harry had time to realize that in
      his earnestness he was rather overstepping bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do not mean to ask you to promise me,&rdquo; he stammered, coloring
      up to the roots of his hair, &ldquo;but you know what I mean. I am so anxious
      you should meet them half way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think we really ought to go? Why, a Dancing Assembly is the last
      thing in the world we care to have a hand in. But Mrs. Boniface will not
      stir a step when she hears about this wholesale murder of the Bentons, so
      that settles it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you feel that you <i>must</i> tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course there is no must about it. I will think it over,&rdquo; and then
      the Captain and Harry entered into a thorough discussion of the events
      that had led up to the sad consummation in South Carolina, and Harry had
      some facts at his command by which he succeeded in partially convincing
      the Captain that, in many cases, the Tories had been treated very much as
      they deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Harry, you may be right, you may be right,&rdquo; sighed the Captain,
      &ldquo;but that does not make the sacrifice of my old friends any easier to
      bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a whit, sir, I can understand that,&rdquo; and then they started toward the
      house, for they could see that Mrs. Boniface and Frau Van Vleet were
      taking formal leave of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was settling down upon the river, and in those days, when it was
      the custom for fashionable dancing parties to begin at five o'clock, it
      was surely fitting that the same hour should conclude an unfashionable
      Dutch tea-party. Indeed, by the time darkness had fairly mastered the
      twilight, all the Van Vleets were snugly in bed, and only one light could
      be seen in the whole farm-house; that was in the window of Aunt Frances's
      gable room. There she sat reading, by the light of a plump little Dutch
      candle, certain familiar passages from some dearly loved books. She knew
      most of them by heart, and yet to much pondering of the noble, uplifting
      thoughts of these comforting little books was due much of that cheerful
      courage which was such a help to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the &ldquo;Grayling&rdquo; sailed &ldquo;up river&rdquo; and &ldquo;cross river,&rdquo; and reached
      her dock. She had one more name on her list of cabin passengers, however,
      than when she had sailed that morning, for how could Aunt Frances say &ldquo;No&rdquo;
       when Hazel had come to her and begged that she would please be so very
      good as to let them have Starlight for over Sunday?

      on the porch, &ldquo;I've been thinking.&rdquo;

      work, nor Flutters doesn't, either. He says it is all just fun, and if
      there's a finer family anywhere than the Bonifaces he'd like to see'em,
      only he knows he never shall see'em, because there isn't such a family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you making that up, Job Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess not. Flutters says something of that sort every time we're
      left alone together. It seems as though his heart was so overflowing that
      he just had to ease it whenever he got a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's certainly very pleasant to have him feel like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he just worships the ground&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight paused to shy a stone at a guinea hen that was encroaching on
      one of the flower beds&mdash;&ldquo;your <i>mother</i> treads on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight knew well enough that he ended this sentence quite differently
      from what Hazel had expected; but Hazel was wise enough not to show her
      surprise, and besides, if there was any worshipping to be done, she was
      about as glad to have Flutters worship the ground her mother trod on as
      that over which her little feet had travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I've been thinking,&rdquo; she said, resuming her own line of thought,
      &ldquo;that, for all we know, Flutters may be a regular little heathen, for I
      have an idea that the mulattoes are a very savage tribe. Did you ever hear
      him say a word about religion, or what he believed, and things like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight scratched his head, by way of helping his memory. &ldquo;Never a word,
      come to think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, Starlight, that is very strange, and I believe I'll take him
      to church this very morning, and see how he acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let's,&rdquo; said Starlight, taking most kindly to the project. &ldquo;If he's
      never been in one, it will be awful fun to see how he takes it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People don't go to church to have awful fun. If that's what you're going
      for, you had better stay home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight clapped his hand over his mouth, as though to suppress a most
      explosive giggle. &ldquo;My gracious, Hazel! What has come over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing has come over me, and you know it. I always love to go to church,
      and I love everything they do there; and I think it's beautiful where they
      sing, 'Lord, have mercy upon us,' after the commandments, and everybody
      keeps their head bowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight did not answer. It was evident Hazel was launching upon one of
      what he called her &ldquo;high-minded moods;&rdquo; and, indeed, child though she was,
      Hazel did have times when she thought very deeply&mdash;times when the
      soul that was in her seemed to reach out after things eternal. It was not
      at all an unusual experience. It does not always need even ten round years
      to bring a child to a point of knowing for itself that there is a longing
      that this world, all wonderful and beautiful though it be, does not fully
      satisfy. Such a knowing does not make a child less a child, or rob it of
      an iota of its joyousness, only sometimes lends a sweet and earnest depth
      to the little God-given life. But to matter-of-fact Job Starlight, it must
      be confessed that such a mood was not at all satisfactory. He did not
      comprehend it, and standing in awe of Hazel's &ldquo;high mindedness,&rdquo; always
      endeavored to bring her down to his own level as quickly as possible by
      means of some diverting subject. This time he fortunately spied it in the
      shape of two prim little maidens, Prayer-Book in hand, who came demurely
      walking, side by side, down the path that skirted the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there come the Marberrys,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said Hazel, flying to the gate. &ldquo;Are you going to church?&rdquo;
       she called over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the little Marberrys simultaneously; indeed, they were a
      pair of simultaneous children. In the first place, they were twins; in the
      second place, they were as alike in appearance as peas in a pod, and, in
      the third place, one little brain seemed to be the perfect fac-simile of
      the other. It was no uncommon thing for them to utter the same thought, in
      the same words, at the same time; and when this did not happen, one would
      generally echo what the other had said. They had been christened Mathilde
      and Clothilde; but Milly and Tilly had been the outcome of that, and of
      course the similarity in the sound of the two names led to much confusion,
      since the initial letter was all that distinguished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel had come to the wise conclusion &ldquo;that, so far as possible, it was
      best just to say things that would do for both, because, like as not, if
      you meant to say something to Milly&mdash;it not being so understood&mdash;Tilly
      would answer, and <i>vice-versa</i>.&rdquo; But these two little Marberrys were
      warm friends of hers, and in those days, when so many people were
      estranged from the Bonifaces, she set a specially high value upon their
      friendship. Not that the Marberrys were in any sense Tories; only, as Dr.
      Marberry was rector of St. George's, they felt it their duty, as a family,
      to be kind to everybody in the church. Besides, it would have caused the
      twins a real pang to have been parted from Hazel, for, as they frequently
      asserted in the presence of less favored playmates, &ldquo;Hazel Boniface was
      the cutest and nicest girl they had ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight's announcement of &ldquo;Here come the Marberrys&rdquo; had suggested to
      Hazel the idea of joining forces and all going along together. The
      children were delighted with the plan, as with any plan of hers, and sat
      down for a friendly chat with Starlight, while Hazel hurried away to
      summon Flutters. She found him feeding some withered clover heads to
      Gladys, as he sat comfortably on the top rail of the fence, enclosing the
      meadow where Gladys was allowed to disport herself on high days and
      holidays. She waited till she got close up to him, then she announced,
      &ldquo;Flutters, you are to go to church with me this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To church!&rdquo; he said, surprised, for he had not heard her coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go put on the other suit, and meet me at the gate quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not say &ldquo;your other suit,&rdquo; feeling, naturally, a certain sense of
      personal ownership, as far as Flutters's outfit was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he answered, moving off with the alacrity of a
      well-trained little servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will not care to go with me, girls,&rdquo; Hazel remarked, as she
      came down the path, some five minutes later, and looking very pretty in
      her dark red Sunday dress. &ldquo;You see I am going to take Flutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should we mind that?&rdquo; chirped Milly Marberry in a high musical
      little key, and Tilly remarked, &ldquo;Yes, why should we mind that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have no idea how he will behave. When I told him just now that
      he was to go to church with me, he said, 'To church!' as though he was
      very much surprised and had never been in one in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he'll sit still, though, if you tell him to,&rdquo; said Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he will not speak if&mdash;&rdquo; but Tilly's sisterly echo was
      interrupted by a significant hush from Hazel, and the next second Flutters
      was with them. Then the little party set off, the boys ahead together, and
      the girls behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Flutters come from, anyway?&rdquo; asked Tilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, where from?&rdquo; piped Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From England,&rdquo; Hazel answered, softly, &ldquo;but he's a mulatto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mulatto. They're a kind of negro tribe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the mulattoes wild and dangerous?&rdquo; asked Milly, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe so; but then, of course, Flutters isn't so now.
      Civilization has changed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Marberrys looked at Hazel with admiration; these occasional big words
      of hers constituted one of her chief charms in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the truth is,&rdquo; Hazel continued, &ldquo;I do not know very much about
      Flutters. He does not seem to like to talk about his history, and mother
      says I have no right to pry into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't think anybody who had been wild and savage could speak such
      good English,&rdquo; said Tilly, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither should I,&rdquo; said Milly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is queer,&rdquo; and Hazel looked puzzled. &ldquo;I hadn't thought of
      that; but I'm certain his grandfather, if not his father, must have been
      wild and savage. I'm very sure the mulattoes used to be very ferocious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do the mulattoes live?&rdquo; asked the Marberrys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; was Hazel's truthful answer. The fact was, as you have
      discovered, Hazel did not know what she was talking about. She had a trick
      of mounting an impression, and then of giving rein to her imagination and
      letting it run away with her, so that the first thing she knew she was
      telling you something she really quite believed was fact, but which was
      nothing of the sort. As a result she was sometimes credited with fibbing,
      and got into many an unnecessary scrape, but, you may be sure, Mrs.
      Boniface was doing all that she could to correct this unfortunate
      tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the boys walked ahead, conversing with no little earnestness as
      to the comparative merits of two tiny sloop yachts, one of which was
      taking shape under Starlight's hand, and the other under Flutters's, and
      whose same comparative merits were to be put to the test, when completed,
      by a race on the waters of the Collect. At this point in their walk a turn
      of the road brought St. George's into sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever been to church, Flutters?&rdquo; Starlight asked, quite casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Episcopal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye' ep,&rdquo; was Flutters's unceremonious answer; &ldquo;but how large are you
      going to make your foresail?&rdquo; not willing to be diverted from the
      all-engrossing subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give her all the sail she can carry, you may be certain.&rdquo;
       Starlight did not intend to furnish this rival yachtsman with any exact
      measurements. And so they talked on till they reached the little stone
      church, where service had already commenced. The Marberrys walked straight
      up to their pew, the very front one, but before they reached it each
      little face flushed crimson. At one and the same moment their two pairs of
      blue eyes met their father's, for he was leading the General Confession,
      and did not need to have them upon his book. Judging from the crimson on
      their faces, the look must have said, &ldquo;There is no excuse for this, my
      little daughters; I am ashamed that you should be so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel and Starlight and Flutters had the Boniface pew to themselves, but
      Hazel allowed Starlight to precede them into it, while she detained
      Flutters in the vestibule for a little seasonable advice. She had intended
      to administer it slowly and forcibly by the way. Now she had to compress
      it all into one hurried little moment. In her excitement she seized hold
      of Flutters's brown wrist, as she whispered, hurriedly, &ldquo;Flutters, this is
      a church, where people come to worship. You will have to sit very still
      and not speak, only get up and sit down when I do, because part of the
      time it's wrong to sit down. So, Flutters, watch me very closely. I will
      find you the place in the Prayer-Book, but you had better not say the
      things that are written there, even if you can read them, 'cause they're
      probably things you do not understand at all, and don't know anything
      about, so it would be best not to say you believed them. You can sing the
      hymns, though; there won't be any harm in that, only sing very softly, for
      fear you don't get the tune right. Now that is all, I believe,&rdquo; putting
      her finger to her lip in a meditative way, and with an anxious frown on
      her face, as if fearing she had overlooked some important instruction.
      &ldquo;Yes, that is all; now follow me in;&rdquo; and Flutters following her, took his
      seat with a most decorous air, and without staring about with such gaping
      astonishment, as might, perhaps, be looked for in a boy of fourteen, who
      had never seen the interior of a church before, so that Hazel at once felt
      much relieved. Her first duty, of course, was to furnish him with the
      proper page in the Prayer-Book, and her second to anticipate all
      irregularities in the order of service, by taking the book from his hands
      in ample time to supply him with the right place at the right moment. Now
      it must be confessed that all this was accomplished by Hazel in rather an
      officious and patronizing manner, but, unfortunately for her, there came a
      time when she herself was at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know which Sunday it was after Trinity. Flutters <i>did</i>,
      and seeing her confusion anticipated Dr. Marberry by whispering, &ldquo;<i>It's
      the eighteenth Sunday, I think.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0034" id="linkimage-0034"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0130.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Hazel thrust Flutters's Prayer-Book back into his hand, giving him one
      look, and such a look! It was dreadful to think that a thorough-going
      little church-woman could <i>ever</i> look like that, much less while the
      service itself was actually in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters felt &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; He saw how much there was in that look of Hazel's,
      and wondered if he had been greatly to blame in the matter. Starlight, of
      course, witnessed the whole proceeding, and heard Flutters's whisper (as
      did every one else in the neighborhood), which betrayed his familiarity
      with the service, and Starlight himself wondered how he managed to be
      quite so well up on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was an awfully good joke on Hazel. When they had been discussing
      the matter, and he had said, &ldquo;It would be awful fun to see how Flutters
      would act in church, provided he had never been there,&rdquo; Hazel had, of
      course, been quite right in saying that &ldquo;People did not go to church to
      have awful fun,&rdquo; but he could not help thinking that he had had a little
      fun all the same, only at Hazel's expense, and not Flutters's.

    <p>
      HERE were five of them abreast. The Marberrys, Hazel, Starlight, and
      Flutters, but no one was saying a word. The Marberrys had twice
      religiously tried to start up matters, but had failed utterly, and new
      they were anxiously bothering their little minds with the same question,
      so often reiterated by the Van Fleet parrot, of &ldquo;Oh, dear, what can the
      matter be?&rdquo; Starlight was chuckling inwardly, like the inconsiderate
      youngster that he was. Hazel was very angry, as she imagined with just
      cause, and Flutters was inwardly fluttering, almost outwardly, in fact, so
      sorry was he to have offended his adored little mistress. If she would
      only say something. It was not his place to speak first, but he feared he
      would have to, for to his sensitive nature the silence was unbearable.
      Fortunately, however, just at this point, Hazel's indignation found vent;
      she came to a sudden stand-still, and although naught save the one word &ldquo;<i>Flutters</i>&rdquo;
       escaped her, it doubled the five-abreast parallel line into a circle in
      less than a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done, Miss Hazel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;&mdash;then impressively lowering her voice&mdash;&ldquo;you have lied,
      Flutters&rdquo; (the Marberrys winced). &ldquo;Yes, I know it is a dreadful word, but
      there is no other word for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I lie about?&rdquo; Body-servant or no, Flutters knew when his little
      mistress was overstepping all legitimate bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me you had never been to church, and let me find all the places
      for you, when you knew all about it just as well as I did,&rdquo; and the little
      mistress was so greatly excited, that she felt very much afraid she should
      break right down and cry, which would certainly prove a most undignified
      proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Did</i> I tell you, Miss Hazel, that I had never been to church?&rdquo;
       Flutters was able to speak calmly and was astonished at his own
      self-control, but then he knew he was in the right, and calmness comes
      easier when you know that. Hazel grew uncomfortable under Flutters's
      direct gaze. She had hardly expected this courageous self-defence. Come to
      think of it, <i>had</i> he actually said he had never been to church.
      Could it be, she wondered, that her imagination had led her off on another
      wild chase in the wrong direction? Yes, it could, foolish little Hazel,
      though you yourself are not yet ready to admit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you did not tell me so, Flutters,&rdquo; Hazel answered, &ldquo;but you <i>let</i>
      me think it, which was very wrong and mean of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Hazel,&rdquo; chimed in Starlight, shaking his head significantly,
      &ldquo;ten to one you never gave him a chance to say a word about it. You have
      an awful, rushing way, sometimes, of taking things for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Starlight was siding against her too, and Hazel looked toward the
      Marberrys for sympathy; but they were so ignorant of the facts of the
      case, and always so kindly disposed toward that little waif, Flutters,
      that both of them wore the most neutral expression possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters's face flushed gratefully under Starlight's warm championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;you never gave me a chance to tell
      you, and until you caught hold of my wrist in the vestibule, and told me
      what I must do and what I mustn't, I did not know that you even thought I
      had never been to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you really? Well, that's very queer,&rdquo; for when an idea was firmly
      implanted in Hazel's mind, she felt as though every one ought, somehow or
      other, to be intuitively aware of it. However, she was going to try to be
      reasonable, and so she descended from a tone of evident displeasure into
      one of grieved forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Flutters, if what you say is true&rdquo;&mdash;Flutters straightened up
      under this insinuation, but unbent right away as Hazel wisely added, &ldquo;and
      of course it is, then why, when I found the first place in the Prayer-Book
      for you, did you not whisper, 'You need not bother, Miss Hazel, I know
      about the Prayer-Book,' or something like that, instead of letting me go
      on and find place after place for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Flutters seemed at a loss what to answer, then looking her
      frankly in the face, he said, with charming simplicity, &ldquo;I thought it
      would be more respectful not to say anything; and better to let you, being
      my little mistress, do just as you pleased without interfering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazel showed she was touched by this confession; but Starlight could not
      resist the temptation to add, &ldquo;besides, I warrant you, you told Flutters
      not to speak, when you collared him there in the vestibule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; said Flutters, truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That maybe,&rdquo; Hazel admitted with much dignity, &ldquo;but, Job Starlight, I
      never <i>collared</i> anybody, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be touchy, Hazel. You know what I mean.&rdquo;

      All this while the children had stood in a little circle right in the
      middle of the road, and more than one passer-by had looked on with an
      amused smile, wondering what was the cause of so much evident excitement.
      The Marberrys had noticed this, and now that matters were cooling down a
      trifle, suggested that they should walk on, so as not to attract so much
      attention. So they walked on, but of course they talked on too, and
      although Hazel was fast relenting toward Flutters, she was not quite ready
      to cease hostilities. One or two matters still required explanation. &ldquo;Look
      here, Flutters,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you thought it was more respectful not to
      say anything, why didn't you keep quiet; and there's another thing I <i>should</i>
      like to have you tell me, and that is, how did <i>you</i> know it was the
      eighteenth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel, when I saw you did not know what Sunday it was, I thought
      that as I happened to know, I <i>ought</i> to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was it; but, Flutters, people don't just happen to know things.
      They generally know <i>how</i> they came to know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters looked troubled, and the Marberrys and Starlight felt very sorry
      for him, and wished Hazel would stop. But Hazel wouldn't. That's one of
      the troubles with strong and independent natures, no matter whether they
      belong to big or little people. They feel everything so deeply, and get so
      wrought up, that on they go in their impetuosity hurting people's feelings
      sometimes, and doing lots of mischief. To be strong and independent and to
      know where &ldquo;to stop,&rdquo; that is fine; but Hazel had not yet learned that
      happy combination. But Hazel's heart was all right; she wanted above
      everything else in the world to grow some day to be a truly noble woman,
      and there is not much need for worry when any little body really hopes and
      intends to be that sort of a big body. But you need not think that while I
      have been saying this little word behind Hazel's back (which, by the way,
      is not meant at all unkindly), that you have been missing any conversation
      on the part of our little church-goers. There hasn't been any conversation
      for ever so many seconds. Hazel is waiting for Flutters to speak, and
      Flutters is getting ready. At last he attacks the subject in hand, in
      short, quick little sentences, as if it was not easy to say what must be
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hazel, when I was at home I used often to go to church. I had a
      little Prayer-Book of my own. <i>Somebody</i> gave it to me; somebody that
      I loved. When I was in the circus I kept my Prayer-Book with me. Every
      Sunday I read it, from love of the somebody. Once in a great while when we
      would put up near a church I used to get leave to go to it. I went the
      very Sunday before I left the circus. I went to that very church where we
      have been to-day. I sat in the back seat, and I heard their father preach
      (indicating Milly and Tilly). It was a lovely sermon 'bout bearing things.
      That was five weeks ago, and that was the thirteenth Sunday after Trinity,
      so I calculated up to to-day, and, Miss Hazel, when I ran away from the
      circus and dared not go back there were only two things I minded about&mdash;the
      Prayer-Book and old Bobbin. To run away from a dear little book that you
      loved, that's been a real comfort to you, when you hadn't scarce anybody
      to turn to&mdash;why, it seems just like running away from a dear old
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was the explanation of it all. Even Starlight felt touched by
      Flutters's narration, while actual tears stood in the little Marberrys'
      eyes. Hazel felt humiliated, an uncommon, but most beneficial sensation
      for that hot-headed little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave you that Prayer-Book, Flutters?&rdquo; asked the Marberrys&mdash;being
      blessed with less tact than sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters would have told us if he had wished us to know,&rdquo; said Hazel. And
      that considerate remark completely re-established the old friendly
      relations between Flutters and herself, and then for a while the five
      children trudged along in silence. Four out of the five were probably
      pondering over all that Flutters had told them, and wishing that they knew
      more about him. Flutters, feeling greatly relieved, was turning over in
      his mind a perplexing question suggested by something the Rector had said
      in his sermon that morning, for he was a thoughtful little fellow, and
      when a matter bothered him was not content to dismiss it without settling
      it to his own satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do folks believe?&rdquo; he said, after the manner of one who has slowly
      thought himself up to the point of putting a question, &ldquo;do folks believe
      that God makes everything happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they do,&rdquo; said Milly Marberry. Tilly pressed her lips firmly
      together and nodded &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; in a way that meant there was no doubt whatever
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose a poor woman had just one little boy, and the little boy
      took the scarlet fever and died, did God make that happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, He did,&rdquo; replied Milly and Tilly together, feeling, perhaps, that,
      as daughters of the Rector, the answering of such a question belonged to
      them. Starlight and Hazel willingly kept silent. They thought Flutters was
      leading up to something, and preferred not to commit themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Flutters, but not irreverently, &ldquo;I'd like to know what
      He did it for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milly and Tilly showed their surprise at this question, but did not at
      once reply, trying, perhaps, to decide what answer their good father would
      make under similar circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps God saw the little boy would not grow up to be a good man,&rdquo; Milly
      ventured, feeling sure she had heard something like that said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Tilly, for occasionally the twins did launch out on
      independent lines of thought, &ldquo;perhaps she loved the little boy too much,
      and so God took him to make her trust more just in Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters waited a moment, as though to consider matters; then he said,
      seriously, &ldquo;No, I do not believe what you say at all. I believe the little
      boy caught the scarlet fever from somebody, and just died because he
      wasn't strong enough to get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it's right to think like that,&rdquo; Hazel volunteered, for
      the Marberrys looked very much shocked, &ldquo;it's not believing in God at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Flutters had not set out upon this discussion without first having
      thought it out pretty clearly for himself, and so he was ready to answer&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are mistaken, I think, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; with the same little air of respect he
      always assumed in speaking to her, &ldquo;because I believe in God just as much
      as any boy could, and yet I think that. I think God <i>lets</i> things
      happen instead of making them. He lets sickness and trouble come into the
      world, and so the sickness and trouble find the people out, and sickness
      kills them if their bodies are weak, and trouble kills them if their
      hearts and heads are, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Flutters,&rdquo; interrupted Starlight, &ldquo;don't you believe God watches
      over people and cares for 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course I do, Starlight. If I hadn't thought that I don't know what
      I would have done sometimes; but this is what I think&mdash;I think He
      watches over us by helping us to bear things, and to get the best out of
      'em, and although I'm not very old, I'm old enough to know that sometimes
      there is more good in a trouble-some thing than in a thing that isn't
      troublesome at all. The people who are the kindest are often the people
      who have had the most trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tilly Marberry, with considerable censure in her tone, &ldquo;I
      never heard a little boy talk like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; sighed Milly, &ldquo;and I should say such things ought to be
      left to grown-up people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Flutters replied, &ldquo;thinking 'bout things ought to be left to
      grown-up people, too, but it isn't. I may think <i>different</i> when I'm
      grown up, but I don't believe I'll ever think harder than I do now, and I
      can't help it either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Hazel had been ransacking her brain for a half-remembered text,
      and now she had it. &ldquo;What do you make out of that verse about the Lord <i>chastening</i>
      whom He loves?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment Flutters looked puzzled. The Marberrys signalled each other
      by elevating their eyebrows as to the meaning of this last big word of
      Hazel's, and asked, simultaneously, &ldquo;What's chastening?&rdquo; Then for the
      moment Hazel looked puzzled, but Starlight came to her rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's taking away from a fellow lots of people whom he loves.
      Having his mother die, and then his father, and then his little sister,
      and things like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark of Starlight's flashed the light again in upon Flutters's
      mind, and he found to his glad surprise that he was thoroughly prepared to
      answer Hazel after all; but he began by asking Starlight a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Starlight, does the Lord do that, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;so as to make a fellow resigned. I think that's what they call
      it. To make him just give up his own will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Flutters, with the air of one whose convictions are very
      strong, &ldquo;but I don't believe <i>that</i> either. I don't believe the Lord
      would take my father and mother and sister out of the world just because
      He loved me and wanted to make <i>me</i> better. I don't believe I'm
      important enough for that, nor anybody else. If they all died close
      together I should think it was because God's time had come for them, quite
      outside of me, and that then the thing for <i>me</i> to do, the thing that
      He meant, was just to bear it as bravely as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a long speech for Flutters, but the children were sufficiently
      interested to follow every word of it, and Hazel asked, when Flutters
      ceased, &ldquo;But then what <i>does</i> the chastening verse mean? It's in the
      Bible, and I suppose you believe the Bible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I believe it, but I know chastening doesn't mean anything like
      that. Perhaps it means letting all sorts of bothersome things come so as
      to have you get the best of them. A person what had never had any bother
      wouldn't be much of a person, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we <i>have</i> had a talk,&rdquo; said Starlight, for at this point the
      discussion seemed to come to a natural close; and besides, they had almost
      reached the Boniface gate. A moment later the Marberrys took an
      affectionate leave of Hazel, with a &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to Starlight and Flutters,
      and trudged on to the rectory, half a mile farther up the road, wondering,
      perhaps, if what Flutters had said had been wrong, and provided they could
      remember it, if they ought not to tell their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; sighed Hazel, carefully putting away her Sunday cloak and hat,
      &ldquo;and to think that I thought the mulattoes were a savage tribe! Why,
      really, I believe I never knew a boy who seemed to think so right down
      into a thing as Flutters.&rdquo;

    <p>
      RIGHT and early on the Monday succeeding the Van Vleet tea-party, Harry
      Starlight set out for his call upon Colonel Hamilton. It proved to be a
      clear, bracing morning, the kind of a morning to inspire hope in hearts
      five times as old as Harry's, only fortunately there are <i>some</i>
      hearts that never grow old at all, and to whom hope is just as true and
      beautiful-at sixty as sixteen. The moment he closed the door of the
      kitchen behind him, he drew one great, deep breath, as though longing to
      take in, in a permanent way if possible, all the exhilaration of the
      invigorating air, all the marvellous beauty of the wonderful out-of-door
      world. There had been a heavy frost the night before, but almost the first
      flash of sunrise had transformed it into an army of glistening drops, save
      where here and there, under the protecting chill of sombre shadows, the
      grass-blades still were cased in sheaths of crystal. The river was gray
      and white-capped, for the west wind would not leave it still enough to
      reflect the cloudless blue overhead, and the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; tugged at her
      chain with various little creaks and groans, as though an anchor and a
      furled sail were more than sail-boat nature could endure when such a
      breeze was blowing. Indeed, as Harry freed her from her moorings, she
      fairly seemed to bound out into the river with the keen enjoyment of a
      creature alive in every part. It is hard to picture that East River as it
      looked a hundred years ago, with wooded and grass-grown banks in place of
      wharves and warehouses, and with only an occasional sail, where to-day the
      great, unwieldy ferry-boats plow from shore to shore, and an army of
      smaller craft steam noisily hither and thither. Now and then Harry would
      pass a market-boat loaded to the water's edge with a tempting array of
      vegetables, and rowed by a marketwoman in her close-fitting Dutch cap, who
      would either wish him a cheery good-morning in matronly fashion, or bend
      lower over her oars, as became a young maiden. Half reluctantly did Harry
      hear the &ldquo;Gretchen's&rdquo; keel scrape the pebbly shore, and exchange the
      breezy breadth of the river for the city street, notwithstanding that
      street led straight up to Colonel Hamilton's office. Then, somehow or
      other, he did not feel quite so buoyant as at the start, for hope has a
      trick of wavering a little, as she actually nears the verge of any
      decision. What if some one had already secured the place? What if the
      Colonel should not take to him? for Harry had great faith in and great
      respect for what may be called &ldquo;taking to people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that he found only a boy in the Colonel's office, a very
      dark little specimen of the negro race, who was brushing and dusting away
      in a manner that said very plainly, &ldquo;I's behin' time dis mornin',&rdquo; which,
      by the way, was the rule and not the exception in the life of lazy little
      John Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time does Colonel Hamilton usually come in? asked Harry, when he saw
      that the boy was by far too busy to pay any attention to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Long any minit; dat's how I's so flustered,&rdquo; he replied, breathlessly,
      and with that sort of haste which invariably makes waste, he succeeded in
      upsetting all the contents of a generous scrap-basket exactly in the
      middle of the office floor. &ldquo;Glory me!&rdquo; was his one inelegant exclamation,
      and, dropping on to his knees, he began punching the accumulation of trash
      back into the basket, but with an energy that landed half of it upon the
      floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I'll tend to that,&rdquo; laughed Harry. &ldquo;You see to your other
      work.&rdquo; John Thomas looked up surprised, but seeing the offer was made in
      good faith, took Harry at his word, and flew to the office washstand,
      which was sadly in need of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this point there was a step in the hall, and glancing up from his
      homely, self-appointed task, Harry's eyes met those of Colonel Hamilton,
      while the color flushed over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my young friend,&rdquo; said the Colonel, evidently much amused, &ldquo;who set
      you at that work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting for you, sir,&rdquo; said Harry, putting the basket at one side,
      &ldquo;and as your boy seemed to have been delayed, I was trying to lend a
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you, sir; and as John has a way of being delayed every
      morning, he would no doubt like to make a permanent engagement with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather you would do that, sir,&rdquo; was on Harry's lips, but he feared
      it might sound familiar; but Colonel Hamilton seemed to read his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly you came to see about making an engagement with me,&rdquo; he said,
      kindly, looking for the moment most intently at Harry in a way that showed
      he was mentally taking his measure. Meanwhile he had hung up his coat and
      hat, and dropped into a high-backed, uncomfortable and unpainted wooden
      chair, very different from the upholstered, revolving contrivances that we
      find in offices nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Harry, in answer to the Colonel's question, and still
      standing; &ldquo;I heard that you wanted a clerk, and I should be very grateful
      if you would let me see if I could fill the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Starlight Avery, if you wish it in full, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be seated, Mr. Avery?&rdquo; said the Colonel, with his habitual
      kindly courtesy; whereupon John Thomas flourished a bedraggled feather
      brush over a dusty chair&mdash;the same one upon which Hazel had sat
      during her recent important interview&mdash;and placed it near the
      Colonel's, with all the importance of a drum-major on parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard the name of Starlight before,&rdquo; Colonel Hamilton said
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;but where I cannot remember.&rdquo; Then, and as though he had no
      time to devote to mere rumination at that hour of the morning, he asked,
      &ldquo;Are you a native of New York, Mr. Avery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; my home is in New London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are a long ways from it now&rdquo; (for distances were distances in
      those days); &ldquo;how does that happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enlisted on a privateer,&rdquo; Harry answered, coloring slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is how,&rdquo; and the Colonel gave him the benefit of another
      scrutinizing look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever had a position in a lawyer's office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I am sorry to say I haven't; but it's just the sort of position
      I have always wanted. Of course you would have to tell me just about
      everything at the start, but not more than once, I hope, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is the right sort of spirit, thought the Colonel, beginning to run
      through some papers on a letter-file, for, as usual, he had a very busy
      day before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago did you enlist on the privateer?&rdquo; making a little memorandum
      of some other matters on a sheet of paper as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly two years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you aboard of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a month, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where were you the remainder of the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the 'Jersey,' sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no dividing of attention now, and the Colonel laid aside the
      quill pen he had just filled with ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you were a prisoner aboard of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For nearly two years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is enough for me. Any poor fellow that has braved the horrors of
      that den for even a month ought to have the best sort of a chance. I will
      engage you on the spot, Mr. Avery. If you have been a 'Jersey' prisoner,
      that is enough for me. I am willing to try a 'green hand,' who has had to
      endure that experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Colonel Hamilton,&rdquo; and Harry's grateful appreciation
      showed plainly in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you stay to-day,&rdquo; asked the Colonel, &ldquo;and let me set you right to
      work at some copying? I think we can come to a satisfactory arrangement
      about terms when I am not so hurried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Harry stayed&mdash;stayed through one of the busiest and
      happiest days of his life; and not until twilight had long settled down on
      the river did he step aboard of the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; and set sail for the old
      Van Vleet Farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wind is right in your favor, and you have little to do but mind
      your helm, you have a fine chance for a quiet think&mdash;that is, if you
      are any sort of a sailor; and Harry improved the opportunity and thought
      hard&mdash;thought of all that the day's good fortune might mean to him:
      of ability to pay his own way for the first time in his life; of a little
      money to be sent off now and then to the younger brothers in New London,
      and then, in a vague sort of a way, of a home of his own some day.
      Meantime all the while there would be the constant daily companionship
      with Colonel Hamilton himself, who seemed to him (as indeed to many
      another, and in the face, too, of his extreme youthfulness) at once the
      noblest, the kindest, and by far the greatest man he had ever met. What a
      pity, he thought, that he should have sided against Aunt Frances!
    </p>
    <p>
      But of one thing Harry felt sure, which was that he had certainly &ldquo;taken
      to&rdquo; Colonel Alexander Hamilton; and there was another thing just as sure
      which he did not know about, and that was that the Colonel had decidedly
      &ldquo;taken to&rdquo; Harry.

    <p>
      HE night for the first Dancing Assembly had come, and old Peter, John
      Thomas's father and the janitor of the Assembly room, had done more work
      in the last week than in all the whole five months between the two seasons
      of social gayety. In an hour now it would be time for the guests to
      arrive, and, arrayed in his best coat and knee-breeches, and with nothing
      further to do, Peter sat on a three-legged stool at one end of the hall,
      surveying his work with evident satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently there was the sound of several pairs of feet on the flight of
      stairs that led up to the Assembly rooms, and Peter, craning his neck,
      tried to make out who it might be without taking the trouble to get up,
      for his old knees were very stiff from the unwonted exertions of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who it might be was quickly determined, for in a flash there stood before
      him what seemed to him a veritable crowd of children, though in point of
      fact there were only the two Marberrys, Hazel, Starlight, and Flutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you chilluns doin' heah? Dis heah ain't no place fur chilluns. You
      better go right 'long home agin, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter tried to speak gruffly, but they were not in the least intimidated,
      knowing that it was all assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, we have a great favor to ask of you,&rdquo;' said Hazel, who seemed to
      be the ringleader of the little party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't no sort o' use, Miss Hazel; can't 'low it no how;&rdquo; for Peter knew
      well enough what the favor was; &ldquo;if I let you chilluns into dat gall'ry,
      you'll keep up such a snickerin' and gigglin', you'll 'sturb the whole
      Assembly. No, Miss Hazel; can't t'ink of it; can't 'low it no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said Hazel, looking at him very searchingly, &ldquo;are you going to
      let anybody in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul, Miss Hazel&mdash;dat is, not a soul 'ceptin' my John Thomas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I thought so,&rdquo; said Hazel, exultingly; &ldquo;and it isn't fair, Peter, to
      do for Thomas what you won't do for us. We've come all the way into town
      just to see the dancing, 'cause mother said she was sure there wouldn't be
      any objection to our peeping through the gallery railing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say dat, sure 'nuff, Miss Hazel?&rdquo; And Peter put his head on one
      side, and looked at Hazel in a very suspicious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; said Tilly Marberry, coming to the rescue; &ldquo;I heard her
      myself; and, Peter, we'll promise not to snicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor giggle, either,&rdquo; said Tilly's other self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of you is which?&rdquo; said Peter, slowly looking at the twins with
      knitted eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Peter, please don't stop to bother 'bout that now,&rdquo; pleaded Hazel,
      impatient of any digression from the main point; &ldquo;but you <i>will</i> let
      us in, won't you?&rdquo; whereupon the other children chimed in with such
      imploring entreaties that the old janitor relented, and, getting on to his
      feet with an evident twinge in his rheumatic knees, felt in his coat-tail
      pocket for the coveted gallery keys. The good deed had its reward then and
      there, in the beaming and grateful faces of the troupe of little beggars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallery in question was a sort of balcony, projecting from the wall at
      one end of the hall, midway between floor and ceiling, and to which access
      was had by a steep little spiral stairway. This gallery was intended for
      the musicians only; but between its gilded, bulging front and the part of
      the platform on which they sat was a space where half a dozen children
      might be comfortably accommodated. More than once, when some reception or
      dance was in progress, Hazel, with a few chosen friends in her train, had
      begged her way into this most desirable retreat, and that was why Peter
      knew &ldquo;what was up&rdquo; the moment he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the little gallery, they found John Thomas there before
      them, complacently installed in the most desirable place; but they were
      far too thankful to have gotten in at all to grudge him his privileged
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a funny sight to see the little company established in a row behind
      the heavy gilded stucco work, which completely concealed them, yet offered
      such convenient little loop-holes and crannies, from which everything
      going on on the floor below could be plainly viewed. To be sure, the
      arrangement of the platform obliged them all to sit tailor fashion&mdash;rather
      a constrained position for those unaccustomed to it&mdash;but what did it
      matter about one's legs and back when one's eyes were to be feasted with
      lovely ladies and gallant gentlemen and the music they were to dance to
      would be ringing in one's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't the hall look lovely?&rdquo; said Hazel, when at last she had adjusted
      her lower extremities as comfortably as circumstances would admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; answered the Marberrys, each with a sigh of deep appreciation,
      for it had not been an easy thing for them to gain permission to accompany
      Hazel, and this was to be their first introduction to the glories of a
      dancing assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How everything shines!&rdquo; said Flutters, quite lost in admiration of the
      glittering brass sconces, with their bevelled mirrors and beautiful red
      candles, and wondering greatly how any floor could ever be brought to such
      a high state of polish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course it shines,&rdquo; said John Thomas. &ldquo;It ought to shine. My father
      hasn't been reachin' and rubbin', and kneelin' and polishin' fur free
      weeks fur nuffin, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you help him?&rdquo; asked Flutters, with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0040" id="linkimage-0040"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0149.jpg" alt="0149 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0149.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sah, I did not. I hasn't no time for polishin'. I assists in Colonel
      Hamilton's law office,&rdquo; and John Thomas proudly drew himself up till his
      woolly head grazed the ridge of the gallery rail above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Starlight', &ldquo;are you the boy in Colonel Hamilton's office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assists Colonel Hamilton,&rdquo; John Thomas repeated, not being willing to
      bring himself down to Starlight's offensive way of putting things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've heard about <i>you</i>!' said Starlight, with a mischievous
      twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'at you heard, I'd like to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Thomas,&rdquo; came a voice from below, &ldquo;don't let me hear anoder word
      from you dis ebenin', else home you go to mammy right smart, I can tell
      you, and de oder chiliuns long wid you too.&rdquo; Old Peter had shambled out to
      the middle of the floor to take one more satisfactory view of things in
      general, and just in time to hear John Thomas's excited tones. His words
      had the desired effect; the little gallery instantly relapsed into
      absolute silence, the six children fairly holding their breath for fear of
      the threatened banishment. People were beginning to come now. A few
      gentlemen were already on the floor, and the musicians, who had taken
      their places on the gallery platform, were drawing instruments, which
      would look funny enough to-day, from the depths of clumsy green baize
      bags, and beginning to &ldquo;tune up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me w'at you heard?&rdquo; demanded John Thomas of Starlight, as soon as he
      dared to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, John Thomas, please don't!&rdquo; begged Milly Marberry, putting her little
      hand most beseechingly on his sleeve; &ldquo;we've never been to an Assembly
      before. We'd cry our eyes out if your father sent us home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Thomas yielded to this entreaty, but sullenly, as though he meant to
      have it out with Starlight some day or other. Any slur upon his character
      was just one thing that that young gentleman was determined not to endure,
      and the sooner Job Starlight and the rest of the world came to that wise
      conclusion, why, so much the better for everybody concerned&mdash;at
      least, so thought john Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity that at the commencement of the Assembly Hazel, Milly, and
      Tilly could not have been in two places at once, for while only an
      occasional couple strolled on to the dancing floor, the dressing-rooms
      were crowded. There would have been a peculiar pleasure for those little
      lovers of finery to see the pretty toilets gradually emerge from the
      concealment of long cloaks and shawls, and to have studied the charming
      vanities of peak-toed, high-heeled little slippers as the protecting
      pattens were shaken off into the hands of maids, upon their knees before
      their &ldquo;ladies.&rdquo; But at last the Assembly floor offered more attractions
      than the dressing-room, and a long line of couples, constantly reinforced
      by new arrivals, were promenading in stately fashion around the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There come the Van Vleets,&rdquo; exclaimed Starlight, as Miss Francesca and
      Miss Heide entered, each on the arm of an escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there isn't Miss Pauline,&rdquo; whispered Tilly Marberry; &ldquo;does <i>she</i>
      dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance!&rdquo; said Starlight; &ldquo;well, I guess you'll think so when you see her.
      She's just as graceful as a fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's just as queer as a fairy, too,&rdquo; remarked Flutters. &ldquo;I wouldn't care
      to be the one to dance with her; there'd be no telling what she might fly
      off and do next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very distressing about Miss Pauline,&rdquo; said Hazel, reprovingly; &ldquo;and,
      Flutters, you have no occasion to speak like that.&rdquo; Hazel always seemed to
      be specially successful in mustering large words when she felt called upon
      to administer any reproof to this little servant of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No occasion!&rdquo; said Flutters, significantly, for the recollection of an
      apple-tree and a crying maiden was not so far removed as to lose any of
      its poignancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; questioned Hazel, with a puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing particular,&rdquo; Flutters said, quickly, seeing what an
      explanation might lead up to, and then he succeeded in changing the
      subject by announcing the arrival of Captain and Mrs. Boniface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, doesn't mamma look lovely!&rdquo; and Hazel's happy little face flushed
      with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and just look at Josephine!&rdquo; sighed the Marberrys, simultaneously,
      for those little women were so overcharged with delight as scarce to be
      able either to speak or breathe in quite regular and commonplace fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>she's</i> the girl,&rdquo; said Starlight, who, whether from honest
      admiration or a spirit of mischief, never lost an opportunity for
      extolling the virtues and attractions of Hazel's older sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she's drawn Harry Avery,&rdquo; added Hazel, for once in her life adroit
      enough not to betray any annoyance; &ldquo;I don't believe she minds, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Harry doesn't mind, I know that much. Shouldn't wonder myself if he
      managed to have it come that way.&rdquo; Starlight evidently spoke from
      knowledge of facts, for, like as not, Cousin Harry had foolishly taken
      that small boy somewhat into his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; that Hazel spoke of was a queer custom of the olden days.
      Partners for the evening were chosen by lot; they danced, walked, and
      chatted with no one else, and when the dancing was over partook together
      of such modest refreshment as rusks and tea. This arrangement was most
      advantageous for the young ladies who were not specially attractive, for
      by means of it the fairest and the plainest were treated exactly alike.
      Now, for all this information, and much more beside, as I told you in the
      preface, we are indebted to that delightful first chapter of Mr.
      McMasters's History; but although you may not be old enough to care to
      read that chapter for yourself, nor half old enough to be allowed to
      attend a Dancing Assembly, nor fortunate enough to gain entrance to a
      little mid-air gallery, where you could watch all the fine goings on
      unobserved, yet I believe you are quite old enough to understand one thing&mdash;and
      that is that the pleasure of those old-time assemblies must have depended
      altogether upon the partner that fell to one's lot. A wretched sort of a
      time, or an indifferent sort of a time, or a very good time indeed&mdash;all
      lay within the possibilities of that one little chance. So do you wonder
      very much, or do you blame them very much, if those old-fashioned beaux,
      with their powdered hair, velvet knee breeches, and silver shoe-buckles,
      &ldquo;sometimes managed things,&rdquo; as Starlight said? At any rate, Harry Avery
      was supremely happy to have Josephine Boniface fall to his lot, and if he
      hadn't been guilty of &ldquo;managing things&rdquo; at all, why, all that remains to
      be said is that he was a very lucky fellow. Miss Pauline formed the only
      exception to this rigidly observed rule, as it was always an understood
      thing that her brother Hans should be her partner, but being, as Starlight
      said, &ldquo;as graceful as a fairy,&rdquo; and quite as light on her feet, it often
      happened that some friend of the Van Fleets would beg a dance of Pauline,
      and give the faithful brother a chance for &ldquo;a turn&rdquo; with his partner in
      exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's Aunt Frances,&rdquo; exclaimed Starlight, suddenly spying her
      seated in a chair at the farther corner of the room. &ldquo;Did she come in with
      the Van Vleets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so; and doesn't she look a picture!&rdquo; said Hazel, fairly
      feasting her eyes upon that much-loved lady. &ldquo;And her dress, girls! <i>isn't</i>
      it lovely!&rdquo; and Hazel, in her eagerness, gave Tilly Mar-berry, who sat
      next to her, a good hard hug. &ldquo;When I am forty or fifty, or whatever age
      Aunt Frances is, I shall wear black velvet and soft old lace about my neck
      just like that. Now I shouldn't wonder&rdquo;&mdash;Hazel spoke slowly, as if
      really giving the matter most thoughtful consideration&mdash;&ldquo;I shouldn't
      wonder if Aunt Frances was as pretty as Josephine when she was a real
      young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I half believe I think she's as pretty now,&rdquo; answered Starlight,
      notwithstanding his constant championship of Josephine's superior charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's she talking to, Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I don't know,&rdquo; said Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dat's Major Potter, a lawyer what practices down our way,&rdquo;
       volunteered John Thomas, &ldquo;and dere! dere comes <i>my</i> Colonel and Lady
      Hamilton. Isn't she a booty? Where's your Aunt Frances now, Mars
      Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just where she was before, John Thomas, the loveliest-looking lady in the
      room. Lady Hamilton <i>is</i> very handsome, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome! well, you'd better believe it; and de Colonel! now jus' look at
      him, chilluns. Isn't he just too elegant! He jus' ought to be a king,
      Colonel Hamilton ought ter, and he's dat kind, he wouldn't speak cross to
      de laziest pickaninny in de land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose he never speaks cross to you, John Thomas,&rdquo; said Hazel,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dere ain't neber no 'casion, Miss Hazel,&rdquo; and John Thomas looked as
      though he considered her remark altogether uncalled for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't dere neber no <i>'casion?</i>&rdquo; asked Starlight, perfectly imitating
      the darkey dialect. &ldquo;How 'bout dat mornin' when you upset de trash basket
      in de middle of de office flo'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat mornin' was a 'ception, Mars Starlight, and it seems to me your
      cousin, Mr. Avery, might fin' somethin' better to talk 'bout dan to be
      detailin' de little events of de office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was great fun to hear John Thomas go on in this fashion. He had the
      reputation of being the most amusing little darkey in the city, and when
      they were not completely absorbed in watching the dancing, Hazel and
      Starlight managed between them to keep him &ldquo;going,&rdquo; to the delighted
      amusement of the Marberrys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the minute hand of the great white-faced clock at the end of the
      hall was marking quarter to eight in no uncertain characters, and Hazel
      had faithfully promised that at eight o'clock her little party should turn
      their backs on the festivities, no matter how alluring and absorbing they
      might happen to be at that particular moment. But it sometimes happens
      that matters of considerable importance come to pass within the limits of
      fifteen minutes&mdash;often, in fact, in much shorter time than that, and
      this was true of the particular fifteen minutes in question.

      HILE Hazel and Starlight, Flutters, John Thomas, and the Marberrys were so
      hugely enjoying watching the people down there on the floor of the
      Assembly, it so happened that some of the people were not enjoying
      themselves at all. Indeed, quite the contrary; for not a few were acting
      unkindly, and others were being treated unkindly; and if there is any
      enjoyment for anybody in that sort of a proceeding, one ought to be
      thankful not yet to have discovered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know how it came about that Colonel and Mrs. Boniface went to the
      Assembly; it was simply because they felt they ought to. If the old
      friends were truly sorry for having been so unfriendly, would it not be
      ungracious for them to decline this invitation? Would it not look as if
      they themselves were still harboring ill-feeling? And you also know that
      Harry Avery had been consulted in the matter, and that his urgent advice
      had been, &ldquo;Go, by all means.&rdquo; So the Colonel and his wife had decided to
      accept quite in the face of all their preferences, and dreading the ordeal
      far more than either was willing to confess to the other. But alas! for
      the decision that cost them such a personal sacrifice, and alas! for the
      hopefulness of Harry's buoyant temperament; for if Colonel and Mrs.
      Boniface ever had reason abundantly to regret any step they had ever
      taken, it was going to this Dancing Assembly; and if ever two proud and
      sensitive hearts were stung to the quick, theirs were that evening. It
      seems that Harry was mistaken in thinking that the invitation had been
      sent because of a general desire to make amends to the Bonifaces. True it
      was that two members of the Assembly Committee had insisted upon their
      being invited, hardly thinking, however, that they would come; but alas!
      in case they did come some other members had resolved to make it very
      uncomfortable for them. Somehow or other nothing seems so completely to
      change a warm human heart into something as cold and hard as a stone as
      what men call a strong party feeling, and party feeling ran very high in
      those days in which our great-grandfathers lived a hundred years ago. That
      is to say, men felt so sure that their own opinions were the only right
      ones that they fairly hated those who did not agree with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that, with cheeks crimsoned from the insults they had
      received, and with blood tingling to their very finger tips Colonel and
      Mrs. Boniface left the room, sending word to Josephine (who had been
      screened from any insult by Harry's chivalrous devotion) to follow them.
      Hazel suddenly missed them from the crowd below, and knew in a flash what
      had happened. Indeed, the color had flushed into her own round cheeks as
      she thought she saw a Mrs. Potter, whose husband was a leading Whig,
      pretend not to see that Mrs. Boniface had made a move toward shaking hands
      with her. But &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I must be mistaken; no lady would be so
      rude.&rdquo; So it would seem, little Hazel; but it often happens that things
      are not what they seem in this queer world of ours; and as Hazel's dear
      mother learned to her sorrow, several others who called themselves ladies
      could be just as rude as Mrs. Potter, and some of them yet more rude.
      Fortunately for the Mar-berrys and Starlight and Flutters, the clock was
      just on the stroke of eight when Hazel made her unhappy discovery, for she
      could not have borne to have sat there another moment looking down on that
      brilliant company, many of whom, looking so fine and attractive, were at
      heart so cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time's up,&rdquo; said Hazel, starting to creep round to the little door at the
      back of the gallery, and not trusting herself to say more than that for
      fear a trembling voice should betray her suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel was the acknowledged commander-in-chief of that little party, and
      difficult as it was to turn abruptly from the fascinating scene, the
      children dropped obediently on to all fours, and followed in her train.
      The Marberrys' carriage was waiting at the door, and Flutters, after
      helping the others in, climbed onto the box beside Jake, the driver. It
      was wonderful the way in which he seemed always to know intuitively the
      &ldquo;proper thing&rdquo; to do. He was constantly placed on such an equal footing
      with the other children that it would have been only natural for him to
      have frequently forgotten that, after all, he was only Miss Hazel's little
      servant; but somehow or other he never did forget it; perfectly free in
      his manner, and never in any sense servile, yet always betraying a little
      air of respectful deference that was simply charming. Indeed, body-servant
      or no, all the Bonifaces had grown to actually loving little Flutters, and
      Flutters knew it and was radiantly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way home Hazel tried to be as merry as before. It would be such a
      pity, she thought unselfishly, to spoil the Marberrys' good time; but she
      did not succeed very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tired, Hazel?&rdquo; asked Milly, as they neared home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, awfully tired,&rdquo; and with this admission the tears sprang into her
      eyes; but fortunately it was too dark in the carriage for any one to see
      them. &ldquo;It's very uncomfortable,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to sit with your legs curled
      under you so long as we had to there in the gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; exclaimed Tilly; &ldquo;why, I could have sat there till
      morning, and never known I had a leg, it was all so lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So lovely!&rdquo; echoed Milly in a tone of evident regret that it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Hazel, as Flutters leaped down and opened the door for
      her; &ldquo;good-night, Milly&rdquo; (a kiss); &ldquo;good-night, Tilly&rdquo; (another kiss);
      &ldquo;much obliged for the ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged for the lovely time,&rdquo; the Marberrys called back, for Jake,
      impatient to get home and to bed, had immediately driven on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it looks as though your father and mother were home,&rdquo; Starlight
      exclaimed as they walked up the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are home, I know that,&rdquo; said Hazel, excitedly, &ldquo;and Josephine
      is home, and I know too that they've had a horrid time, and that they'll
      never go to anything in New York again&mdash;never; and if there is a
      cowardly set of creatures in the world it's the spiteful old Whigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight and Flutters stood aghast, while Hazel flew past them into the
      house, slamming the front door after her, as much as to say that no
      exasperating Whig should ever enter it again, not even if his name was Job
      Avery Starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys sat down on the step of the porch and conversed in dazed, excited
      whispers as to what it could all mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel flew up the stairs into her mother's room and into her mother's arms
      with one great sob.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0159.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hazel, my little daughter, what is the matter?&rdquo; and Mrs. Boniface,
      whom Hazel had found sitting in a low rocker at the window, still in the
      dress she had worn to the ball, drew Hazel's brown head on to her
      shoulder, and soothingly stroked the brown wavy hair; but the tears were
      in her own eyes, and her heart was very heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazel could not speak at first for crying, but the caressing touch of that
      dear hand was wonderfully calming, and presently she was able to say, &ldquo;I
      know all about it, mother. I know they treated you shamefully. I saw that
      horrid old Mrs. Potter when she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hazel! Hazel, dear, you must not talk like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's true, every word of it is true, and tell me&rdquo; (and Hazel
      straightened herself up and looked through blinding tears into her
      mother's face), &ldquo;didn't they insult you? didn't they treat you very
      rudely, and didn't you all come home on that account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they certainly were not very kind, Hazel, and it seemed best for us
      to come home; but it is not worth caring too much about, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think how friendly Mrs. Potter <i>used</i> to be, and how much she
      pretended to think of you, mother,&rdquo; and Hazel becoming a little less
      excited, thoughtfully turned the little turquoise ring on her finger round
      and round, and shook her head sadly from side to side, as though her faith
      in human nature was forever shaken, as indeed it had reason to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty picture, albeit a rather sad one, the mother and daughter,
      in the graceful costumes of a hundred years ago, sitting there in the low
      studded room, dimly lighted by the little rush-light on the mantel&mdash;a
      high narrow mantel, with the glowing embers on the andirons beneath it
      crackling loudly now and then, after the manner of a good fire that is
      slowly dying out. An oblong mirror, hung at a wide angle from the wall,
      surmounted the high mantel, and reflected the little rocker with its
      double load, and the pretty old-fashioned drapery at the window. It was
      not often that that little mirror, nor any other mirror for that matter,
      had the chance to frame a picture for itself full as lovely as ever artist
      dreamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Hazel and her mother were talking, and Hazel herself was growing
      calmer and Mrs. Boniface's heart lighter with the effort to cheer her,
      some other things were happening in which we have an interest. Captain
      Boniface was striding along the road that led on to the Marberrys, trying
      to walk off the angry feelings that threatened to get the mastery over
      him. There is nothing like a good brisk walk in bracing air to get a
      feverish, excited mind into normal condition, and the Captain knew it; but
      when the force of the angry mood had spent itself, there still was left to
      him a sense of sad hopelessness for which he saw no remedy. To have a
      little family on one's hands and no money to care for them is enough to
      make the bravest heart heavy; but to have reached that point, and at the
      same time to see every chance of ever getting on one's feet again
      absolutely taken away, is enough to break a man's spirit. And matters had
      come to just that pass that evening with Captain Boniface. If the old
      friends had at last shown themselves friendly, he would have felt there
      was a hope of his making his services valuable to some of them, as indeed
      there would have been, for every one acknowledged Captain Boniface to be a
      man of rare ability. But it had now been shown him very plainly that there
      was no use in longer trying to stem the tide of hate and prejudice that
      set so strongly against him, and with the future a hopeless blank, he
      finally turned his face homeward. But the other thing that was happening,
      and in which we too have an interest, was of a cheerier sort, and was
      taking place at the Assembly, which had only fairly gotten under way when
      the Bonifaces left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That old-fashioned law of a partner for the evening, to be chosen by lot,
      of course applied only to the young folks, and the more staid,
      middle-aged, and elderly people were free to chat with each other, else
      why should they have cared to go to the ball at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that Aunt Frances, who was quite in ignorance of the sad
      experiences of the Bonifaces, was having a most satisfactory conversation
      with a Mrs. Rainsford, a near neighbor, whom she had not seen since her
      flight from home nearly two years before, for Mrs. Rainsford was able to
      answer a great many questions which Aunt Frances had been longing to ask
      about her own home, and the care it was having.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should not think the place had been greatly abused,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Rainsford, while Aunt Frances sat, an eager listener. &ldquo;Captain Wadsworth
      moved his men down to the barracks at Fort George a month ago, and since
      then he has been giving the house a thorough overhauling. You know he has
      resigned his commission, and intends to remain in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I know, too, that he intends to remain in my home,&rdquo; sighed Aunt
      Frances. &ldquo;I wonder if he would sell it to me, though, for that matter,
      it's as much mine to-day as it ever was. But there's no use to talk about
      that either, for I have saved from the wreck barely money enough to live
      upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Miss Avery,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rainsford in a serious whisper, that was
      scarcely audible above the music, &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing: I do not
      believe Captain Wadsworth <i>will</i> remain in your house very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! why not?&rdquo; and Aunt Frances's elevated eyebrows betrayed her
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because it is going to be so very uncomfortable for all Loyalists
      here in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite see what you mean, Mrs. Rainsford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Rainsford (seeming to regard Aunt
      Frances in the light of an older daughter, though, in point of fact, there
      was but little difference in their ages.) &ldquo;No, of course not; your kind
      heart would never dream of such things as are happening on every side. The
      leading Whigs, now that the Revolution has been successful, say that
      they'll make this town too hot to hold a single Tory, and, mark my words,
      they'll do it, too. Perhaps you haven't noticed how the Bonifaces were
      treated tonight; they went home some time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Rainsford, can that be possible?&rdquo; questioned Aunt Frances,
      looking vainly about the room in search of her friends; &ldquo;I call that
      cruelty of the most unwarrantable sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it must be very humiliating to say the least; but then they have
      brought it upon themselves, you must remember,&rdquo; for Mrs. Rainsford was
      herself a most ardent Whig, and thought the Loyalists, whether English or
      American, should be made to pay very dearly for their behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have seen your garden this summer, Miss Avery,&rdquo; continued
      Mrs. Rainsford, reverting to their former subject. &ldquo;Captain Wadsworth must
      be very fond of flowers. He took the best of care of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could not have borne to see it, Mrs. Rainsford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, perhaps not, dear child; and to think that you really have Alexander
      Hamilton to thank for it all. You must hate him. He is here to-night, you
      know, with his young wife. I don't wonder she turned the heads of the
      officers at Morristown. You know she went to visit her aunt while
      Washington had his headquarters there, and Hamilton was his aide-de-camp,
      and fell in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Aunt Frances, who saw that Colonel Hamilton was
      not very far off, and might easily overhear what they were saying; and,
      indeed, he was not far off, for the very good reason that, in the company
      of his friend, Major Potter, every step was bringing him nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine, if you can, Aunt Frances's surprise when Major Potter, whom she
      knew quite well, paused before her, and bowing low, with old-time grace
      and courtliness, said slowly, &ldquo;May I take the liberty, Miss Avery, of
      presenting my friend, Colonel Hamilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0043" id="linkimage-0043"> </a>

      <a href="images/0163.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Aunt Frances was, of course, greatly confused, though too much of a lady
      to betray it; but Mrs. Rainsford, astonished beyond measure, and not
      always at her ease, was quite glad to slip away from an interview that
      promised to be, to say the least, embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Hamilton took the seat she left vacant. &ldquo;I begged the favor of an
      introduction, Miss Avery, and am very glad to meet you,&rdquo; he said,
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not doubt your sincerity, Colonel Hamilton,&rdquo; Aunt Frances replied
      with no little dignity, &ldquo;but perhaps you do not recognize in me the Miss
      Avery whom you lately defeated in the courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied the Colonel with a deferential air, for Aunt
      Frances was by many years his senior, &ldquo;that is the very reason why I
      wished to meet you. I feel myself to have been the cause&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Colonel Hamilton, but I desire neither apologies nor
      sympathy.&rdquo; For with all her sweetness, Aunt Frances was high spirited; she
      thought the Colonel's manner was a little patronizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colonel Hamilton was high spirited too, and was on his feet in a
      moment. &ldquo;It was not my intention to offer either sympathy or apologies. I
      bid you good-evening, Miss Avery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Frances said quickly, &ldquo;In that case I should prefer you to
      remain, Colonel Hamilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and the Colonel, with no little dignity, resumed his seat,
      while Aunt Frances condescended to add:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to be rude, but I wished you to understand my position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was because I wished you to understand mine that I sought this
      interview, Miss Avery; but I see I have need to be very careful as to my
      choice of words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Frances smiled, as much as to say, &ldquo;Quite right, Colonel Hamilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you realize,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my argument in Captain Wadsworth's
      case was founded on the most sincere convictions;&rdquo; and the Colonel half
      betrayed the admiration which Aunt Frances somehow inspired in him,
      notwithstanding her high-spiritedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never questioned that, Colonel Hamilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I felt I had reason to believe, when I found you had urged your nephew
      to make application for the vacancy in my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I told Harry it was hardly necessary to volunteer the fact of our
      relationship,&rdquo; said Aunt Frances, with unconcealed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He evidently did not agree with you then, for he had been with me scarce
      twenty-four hours before he told me he was your nephew. I suppose you
      thought, if I knew it, that it might count against him; on the contrary,
      let me assure you it has helped him. It is no light thing, Miss Avery, to
      have done any one an injury, whether from conscientious motives or not;
      and I shall welcome every chance to atone for it that comes within my
      power. I can imagine, in part at least, what it must mean to be banished
      from the home of a life-time under any circumstances, and especially when
      you feel that you have still a perfect right to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This looked a little like sympathy on the Colonel's part, but it was too
      kindly meant to be rejected. They were treading, however, dangerously near
      the region of Aunt Frances's proud sensitiveness, so she changed the
      direction somewhat by asking, &ldquo;But Harry is able to rise on his own
      merits, is he not, Colonel Hamilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abundantly; that was one thing I desired to tell you. He has unusual
      capacity, and is remarkably efficient. I think his future assured. As for
      me, it is a great satisfaction to know you do not question my sincerity.
      And now, Miss Avery, I will not detain you longer, and will say
      good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Colonel Hamilton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the Colonel went back to his pretty young wife in the farther
      corner of the room, and Aunt Frances, with a tumult of thoughts in her
      heart, rejoined the Van Vleets, and was glad to find them making ready to
      go down to the clumsy barge, which, manned by two of the farm hands, was
      waiting to carry them home across the moonlit river. How much she had to
      think over; and what had Colonel Hamilton told her but that he would lose
      no chance to atone for what his duty, as he understood it, had compelled
      him to do. But one thing Colonel Hamilton had not told her, but which was
      very true, nevertheless, and that was, that one of the strongest impulses
      toward this same atoning had come to him in the form of a call from a very
      earnest and winsome little maiden one sunny September morning. &ldquo;Yes, what
      may it not mean?&rdquo; thought Aunt Frances, and a hope that she had not dared
      to cherish for a long, long time shaped itself once more before her.
      Perhaps it might come about that she should have her home again some day;
      surely it was not impossible, since Colonel Hamilton himself was enlisted
      in her favor. And <i>this</i> was the man whom she thought her worst enemy&mdash;whom
      she had said she would go a long way to avoid meeting. Very thankful was
      she now that the Colonel had given her no opportunity to carry out her
      intention. So there is this comfort: if some sorry things happened at the
      Assembly, some other things happened that were not sorry at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile poor Starlight and Flutters sat shivering on the front porch.
      Captain Boniface had come home, but had quietly entered the house at the
      rear, and the children had not heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I think we had better go in now,&rdquo; said Flutters, as though he had
      brought the same inducement to bear upon Starlight several times before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go if you like,&rdquo; answered Starlight. &ldquo;It's different with you,
      you live here; but you don't catch <i>me</i> going in at a door that's
      been slammed in my face, unless the some-one who slammed it comes out and
      gets me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Flutters stretched and yawned and shivered a moment longer, and then
      decided to quit the dreary scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't you tell Hazel that I'm out here, Flutters. Promise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if she asks me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not if she asks you fifty times.&rdquo; Starlight was angry, and not
      without reason, but he did not believe impetuous Hazel would give him
      another thought, and so he looked about to see how he could most
      comfortably pass the night on the porch, for he knew nowhere to go at that
      late hour. Perhaps it <i>was</i> a pity for a fellow to be so proud, but
      he could not help it. He wondered if other people's pride made the blood
      rush so hotly through their veins, and made their hearts thump like trip
      hammers; there was one good thing about it, though: it helped to keep him
      a little warmer out there in the chill November evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters groped his way forlornly to bed, for all the lights were out in
      the house. He longed to knock at Hazel's door and tell her about
      Starlight, and his hand actually doubled itself in a preparatory way as he
      passed her door; but no, it would not do. Starlight would never forgive
      him; besides, he had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fortunately it was not to be an out-all-night experience, after all,
      for Starlight. Hazel's room was directly under the roof of the high,
      pillared porch, and as, just before getting into bed, she leaned out to
      close the blinds, so that the morning sun should not wake such a tired and
      sorrowful little body too early, she saw some dark thing lying under the
      mat on the porch. At first she thought it was the Marberrys' dog, who
      occasionally made them a visit, so she called, &ldquo;Bruno! Bruno!&rdquo; in a
      penetrating whisper, but the dark object showed no signs of life. Then she
      said, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; and the dark object moved a little and replied
      sullenly, &ldquo;Who do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Job Starlight, what are you doing out there; you'll catch your death
      of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Starlight, for by this time even his pride had cooled
      down a little, and his teeth were chattering, &ldquo;and there'll be no one to
      blame for it but yourself, Hazel Boniface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Hazel; but as she spoke a conviction of just
      exactly what he meant swept over her. &ldquo;Haven't you been in since I left
      you on the porch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't been in since you slammed the door in my face and said if
      there was a cowardly set of spiteful old creatures in the world it was the
      Whigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not call <i>you</i> a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then Hazel realized that
      it was very foolish, as well as very cold, to stand talking there in that
      way, so she called down, &ldquo;But wait a minute, and I'll come and let you
      in.&rdquo; Then she closed the shutters and hurriedly slipped into her wrapper
      and slippers, and in a twinkling the hall lamp was lighted and the hall
      door thrown open; but Starlight was in no hurry to enter&mdash;not he; he
      was going to see this thing through in right dignified fashion,
      notwithstanding, now that the prospect looked more cheerful, he could
      himself see a funny side to the proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean <i>you</i> were cowardly or spiteful, Starlight,&rdquo; Hazel
      said again. &ldquo;I meant all the other Whigs. Do, please, come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you slam the door in this Whig's face, I'd like to know,&rdquo;
       and Starlight was so gracious as to advance as far as the broad,
      old-fashioned door-sill; &ldquo;besides, all the other Whigs are not spiteful
      and cowardly. Aunt Frances isn't, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starlight,&rdquo; interrupted Hazel, &ldquo;this is very mean of you. If you knew
      what we'd had to bear to-night you wouldn't blame me for anything. I was
      very angry, I know, but I am very sorry, and now&mdash;won't you please
      come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this was as much as the most aggrieved of individuals could
      desire, and Starlight walked in, and dignity and resentment and everything
      else were forgotten as Hazel with tearful eyes told him of the evenings
      experiences. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said at the close of her narration, &ldquo;I saw Mrs.
      Potter with my own eyes refuse to shake hands with mamma, and if it hadn't
      been time then to come home I do not know what I ever should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight drew a deep sigh, but Hazel had grown a full inch in his
      estimation. It was real plucky in her to have kept her forlorn discovery
      to herself all the way home; he could almost understand now how she had
      slammed the door when she reached it. But what a shame it was that a
      family like the Bonifaces should be so shamefully treated! &ldquo;Well, it's too
      bad, Hazel, that's all I can say,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I suppose we may as well
      go to bed. It must be very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where is Flutters?&rdquo; asked Hazel, for the first time recalling his
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered a voice from the top of the hall stairway; &ldquo;I was just
      coming down to see if I could not make Starlight come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe anybody could have <i>made</i> him,&rdquo; said Hazel; &ldquo;the
      Starlights must be a very proud family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So must the Bonifaces,&rdquo; answered Starlight, with the shadow of a smile;
      &ldquo;but, then, I like proud families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; said Hazel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterward the little trio separated, and with the thought of
      &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; Starlight crept gratefully into the bed of the
      little hall room, whose blankets and coverlid had been carefully folded
      back for him, full five hours before, by Dinah's kind black hands.

    </div>
    <p>
      OT a bright outlook certainly, but then, you see, it is to be only a
      little chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people think that children's books ought to be cheery and bright from
      cover to cover, and so they ought&mdash;that is, for the very little
      children; but when they have gotten beyond the days of rhymes and jingles
      and colored pictures, and have wit enough and appreciation enough to enjoy
      a chaptered story, then I, for one, think the stories should be true to
      life. To be sure, the charm of such delightful and purely impossible tales
      as &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Water Babies&rdquo; lies in the fact that they do
      not pretend to be true to anything in the world save the
      enchanting-caprice of the people who write them; but when one comes to
      place a story in a real time, and put real people in it, then it is bound
      to be true to the real things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one certainly does not need to be, say, more than seven years old to
      get at least an inkling of the truth, that the real things of life are not
      always bright things. But there is no use of dwelling at too great length
      upon these same sorrowful experiences, and so for that reason we are going
      to try to make this a short chapter. And now, to tell you right away what
      the sad thing was, for fear your lively imagination should be conjuring up
      something yet more sad than the reality, though the reality was sad
      enough, since it was nothing more nor less than that, when Captain Hugh
      Boniface woke on the morning after the Assembly, he found that he could
      move neither hand nor foot. The eager mind worked as actively as ever, but
      not a muscle would respond to the great, strong will, and the Captain knew&mdash;knew
      beyond all hoping&mdash;that he was completely paralyzed, and that in all
      probability, as far as ever rendering any real service to that blessed
      little family of his was concerned, he had better, from that time, be out
      of the world than in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to tell you very particularly with what foreboding the
      alarming news spread through the little household, nor how breathlessly
      they all waited for old Dr. Melville's verdict as he came from the
      Captain's room a few hours later. Nor of how, in spite of his encouraging
      words, that bade them be hopeful, they read that in his kind old eyes
      which plainly told them that he felt there was little enough to ground any
      real hope upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dr. Melville, gravely, as Mrs. Boniface followed him to the
      door, at the close of one of his professional visits, &ldquo;I feared something
      of this sort might be in store for the Captain. He has been into my office
      several times complaining of certain wretched benumbing feelings that we
      doctors dread to hear acknowledged. But it's not strange, Mrs. Boniface,
      not strange at all; he's been through enough to break down the strongest
      constitution. There was a sight of mischief already done when they brought
      him home from Lexington in '75, and then all these years of worry and
      excitement have not helped matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, doctor,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boniface, nerving herself to ask the question,
      &ldquo;do you think he will never be any better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if he ever walks again, Mrs. Boniface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, Dr. Melville, that it is your opinion that he never <i>will</i>
      walk again. You must be very frank with me, else I cannot tell how to plan
      for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, since you are a brave woman, and I know you mean what you
      say, I will give you my honest opinion, which is this: that your good
      Captain will probably, at least in a degree, regain the use of his hands
      and arms, but never, I fear, of his lower limbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy for Mrs. Boniface to hear her fears put thus plainly into
      words, but it was best, she felt sure, that she should know the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the days dragged wearily along for Captain Boniface, and yet
      brought with them one glorious revelation. Never before had he known quite
      so fully what an all-powerful love there was in his heart for that dear
      wife of his. It was a privilege simply to be able to watch her as she
      moved so quietly about the room, and to listen to the sweet familiar
      voice; and was it not abundant cause for thankfulness that he was still in
      the same world with her, though no longer able to move about in it. But
      what were they going to do? That, of course, was the thought that gave him
      greatest anxiety. The sum of money in the bank had been growing more and
      more slender with every year of diminished income, until now there was
      scarce enough left to tide them over more than another twelve months, and
      then only with the strictest economy. But the good Captain did not have to
      meet this dread question alone, and in the twilight of a November
      afternoon he had talked it all over with his wife, and as the result of
      that long, quiet talk they had decided that Mrs. Boniface should write for
      aid to her father, a clergyman, living alone in a little ivy-grown rectory
      in the South of England. But it was not easy to come to this decision.
      They hesitated to intrude their heavy anxieties upon the good old man,
      whose own income was by no means ample. But there was simply no one else
      to whom they could turn, and they knew he would gladly give them any help
      within his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Hugh, there is nothing for us to do but to wait till the answer
      to my letter comes, and do let us try not to worry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boniface
      when the long talk was over, and they did try, and they succeeded, and
      right in the face of the heaviest trial they had ever known there was
      peace and even an added sweetness in the Boniface home life. The new
      trouble knit all hearts closer together; they realized more keenly than
      ever before how much it was just to have each other, and they cared far
      less than such a little while ago they would have thought possible for the
      insults of people who, after all, had been friends only in name. But half
      the secret of the bravery of the little household lay in the fact that the
      Captain himself was so brave; but often, of course, his courage was
      strongly tested; seldom more strongly than when little Kate would come
      running to the side of his bed, and he felt himself powerless to lift her
      to a seat beside him or to romp with her as he used to love to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, when he was alone in the room, he heard the patter of her
      little feet on the stairway. He could count each step, for, after the
      necessarily slow fashion of very little walkers, she had need to plant
      both feet on one step before attempting another. But at last the patient
      little climber was where she wanted to be, and said, without stopping to
      think, &ldquo;Lift me up, papa, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Kate, you always forget papa can't do that,&rdquo; and the Captain's eyes
      grew misty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I did fordet,&rdquo; Kate answered, with a world of regret in her
      tone; and then she laid her chubby head on her father's arm and tenderly
      stroked the great brown hand as though she loved him more than ever now,
      and for the very reason that he was so helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; said her father, when he felt sure that he could speak and yet
      keep his voice steady, &ldquo;you are such a darling, Kate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma said that a little while ago,&rdquo; answered her little ladyship calmly,
      &ldquo;and Josephine said it yesterday twice, and then Hazel said something like
      it too. I <i>dess</i> I was never quite so nice as lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you were never quite such a comfort,&rdquo; smiled the Captain. &ldquo;But
      then you must not grow too set up about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kate did not pay much attention to this last remark; she had decided on a
      little plan, and was putting it into execution. She pushed a chair to the
      side of the bed and mounted, by aid of its round, to its seat; from there
      it was an easy climb to the bed; and then, shoving the chair away with a
      push of her little foot, she turned to her father with a sigh of honest
      satisfaction, such as no mere &ldquo;lifting up&rdquo; could possibly have occasioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0045" id="linkimage-0045"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Evidently she had come to stay, the blessed little sunbeam, and
      straightway the Captain began to rack his brain for the story that he knew
      well enough in a moment would be asked for, and for the sort that would be
      likely to keep her attention longest. No one could tell so good a story as
      the Captain, and no one could tell it as well&mdash;at least, that was the
      verdict of Starlight and Flutters, of Hazel and the Marberrys, and a few
      other little folk who now and then had the pleasure of hearing him. Little
      Kate was delighted with the fact that she was to be favored with &ldquo;the
      first story since papa fell ill,&rdquo; and, I fear, took a little selfish
      delight in the fact that she was the only listener. As for the story, it
      proved a fine one, with some very queer little people in it, who did most
      outlandish things, and Kate sat entranced till it was finished, and then,
      laying her head down on her father's shoulder, &ldquo;just to think it over,&rdquo;
       fell fast asleep instead, and did not waken, even when the Captain,
      hearing Josephine's step in the hall, called her in to throw something
      over her. And then, after a while, what with Kate's regular breathing as
      she lay on his helpless arm, and what with the light in the room growing
      dim and yet more dim as the glow faded out of the sunset, the Captain fell
      asleep too, and all was so tranquil and peaceful that it seems almost as
      though we had made a mistake in calling this &ldquo;A Sad Little Chapter.&rdquo;

    <p>
      LUTTERS had something on his mind, and this in addition to all the cares
      and anxieties of the Bonifaces, which he took upon himself every whit as
      fully as though he actually belonged to the family. But the something in
      question was a little private affair of his own, an affair, however, that
      insisted upon filling most of his waking thoughts, and finally, after
      looking at it in every possible light, he arrived at a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a person has been thinking about a matter and turning it over and
      over in his mind, a decision is a glorious thing to come to. It is such a
      relief, after standing helpless in a perfect maze of doubt and hesitation,
      to find a straight path opening up before you. At any rate, Flutters's
      sensations were quite of that order, as late one afternoon he went to Mrs.
      Boniface and asked if she could spare him to go into town for a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Flutters,&rdquo; if it is necessary for it was the first time
      Flutters had made a request like that, and she wondered what the little
      fellow was up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters seemed to read her thoughts and answered, &ldquo;It is necessary, Mrs.
      Boniface, but I would rather not tell you what I want to go for, if you
      are willing to trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I'll trust you, Flutters,&rdquo; was the answer that made his heart
      glad; for it is such a fine thing to be thoroughly trusted, and the haste
      with which he donned his coat and hurried from the house showed that, at
      least in his estimation, the something to be done was as important as
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the frosty road, in the November twilight, the little fellow trudged
      at a brisk pace, now and then breaking into a full run, as though in his
      eagerness he could not brook the delay of sober walking. White, fleecy
      clouds were scudding across the sky, as though making way for the moon
      which shone out whenever they would let her, and whose silvery beams were
      following so closely in the wake of the daylight as to create one earth
      night in which, as in Heaven above, there was to be no darkness at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Flutters, like many another preoccupied fellow-mortal, saw naught of
      its beauty, only noting his surroundings sufficiently to take the
      straightest road to his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he brought up at the barracks of Company F at Fort George, which
      company, as you remember, we learned from Mrs. Rainsford, was no longer
      quartered at the Avery homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Sergeant Bellows here?&rdquo; Flutters asked, breathlessly, of one of the
      first men he met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He be,&rdquo; answered the man, with provoking slowness, &ldquo;but I doubt if he'll
      see ye the night, he turned in early with a headache.&rdquo; Flutters looked
      crestfallen. &ldquo;You sail for England day after to-morrow, don't you?&rdquo; >
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do that,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;and it's with pleasure we'll be after
      shaking the dust of the place off us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must see Sergeant Bellows before he goes,&rdquo; said Flutters,
      pathetically. &ldquo;Do you think he'd mind if I disturbed him just for a
      minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;the Sergeant's that good-natured. You'll find
      him in bunk No. 6, in the front room above-stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Flutters climbed the stairs and entered the great cheerless room, with
      its row of uncomfortable-looking bunks lining the wall. A candle was
      burning in a tin candlestick at one end of the room. Flutters went on
      tip-toe and brought it so as to inspect the numbers of the bunks, and make
      no mistake, for he could see that two or three other men had also &ldquo;turned
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who's there?' asked Sergeant Bellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No. 6 was half-way down the room. &ldquo;Sergeant Bellows,&rdquo; said Flutters, in a
      penetrating whisper, screening the candle flame with his hand, so that it
      should not shine in the Sergeant's face.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; asked Sergeant Bellows, raising himself on one elbow and
      bewildered at the sight of his unexpected visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only me, Flutters, and I hope your headache isn't very bad, 'cause I
      wouldn't have disturbed you for the world, only I almost had to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, kindly, &ldquo;but it'll take me a
      moment to get my wits to working, although I wasn't rightly asleep either.
      Here, set the candle on the shelf, and run get that stool yonder for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters felt relieved thus to have the Sergeant take in the situation at
      a glance, and realize that he had come with a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming up to Kings Bridge to-morrow to say good-bye,&rdquo; the Sergeant
      said, rather sadly, when Flutters had seated himself beside the bed. &ldquo;How
      are they up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they're not well at all&mdash;that is, you know, don't you, about
      the Captain's being paralyzed all over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by gracious! paralyzed! Do you mean he can't move hand nor foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters sorrowfully shook his head yes, as though words failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, sorrowfully; &ldquo;but tell me all
      about it,&rdquo; and then Flutters told him everything about the Bonifaces that
      he thought could by any possibility be of any interest to him, till at
      last he felt justified in introducing his own little matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what I came to see about was this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to be sure,&rdquo; said the Sergeant. &ldquo;I had almost forgotten to wonder
      what brought you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Flutters, solemnly, &ldquo;I have a great favor to ask of you,
      Sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not giving me much time to do it, then,&rdquo; said the Sergeant,
      &ldquo;seeing as every British soldier quits the city day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the reason I came,&rdquo; answered Flutters, excitedly, &ldquo;it's in England
      that I want the favor done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have you to do with England, I'd like to know?&rdquo; with evident
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, England was my home,&rdquo; Flutters answered, rather proudly; &ldquo;don't you
      know I belonged to an English circus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so you did; I'd forgotten about that.&rdquo; And then there was a little
      pause, while the Sergeant waited for further developments, and while
      Flutters was meditating how he had best put his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once heard you say, Sergeant, that your old home was somewhere in
      Cheshire, and that's where my father lives. His name is Wainright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your name is Wainright, too,&rdquo; said the Sergeant; &ldquo;Flutters
      Wainright, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Arthur Wainright's my name. Flutters is a name they gave me in the
      circus, because I used to be so scared when I first began to have a hand
      in the tumbling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, in rather gruff, soldier-like fashion,
      &ldquo;if you've a father and he's living, why aren't you living with him 'stead
      of being away over here among strangers? Ye're not a runaway, are ye,
      Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Flutters, scanning the Sergeant's face closely to watch
      the effect of his confession. &ldquo;I had to do it, Sergeant. I was in the way
      at home. My mother was a colored lady, but she died in India, and then my
      father took me to England and married a white lady, and there were some
      white children and I wasn't wanted. They used to say I was such a queer,
      dark little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blest if I blame you, then!&rdquo; said the Sergeant, whose heart was touched;
      &ldquo;but does your father know you're in good, kind hands. I suppose he cared
      more for you than the rest of 'em did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flutters, &ldquo;and so I felt I ought to let him know, and I
      thought perhaps if you didn't mind, you'd hunt him up when you get over
      there, and tell him 'bout me, and how happy I am, and that I send my
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then he might be sending for you to come back. Have you thought of
      that, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've thought of it, but it isn't likely, Sergeant. He knows I'm not
      wanted there; but anyhow, it seems to me I ought to let him know now that
      I'm so well cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, pausing a moment to give the matter due
      consideration. &ldquo;I think you're right about it, and I'll hunt your father
      up just as soon as I can get my furlough and run down to see my relatives
      in Cheshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's my father's name and address,&rdquo; said Flutters, taking a slip of
      paper from his pocket, &ldquo;and when you write to me just direct 'Flutters,'
      care of Captain Boniface. I don't want them to know about me up there. I
      just want them to think of me as an ordinary little darkey, and not above
      any sort of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very good of you,&rdquo; replied Sergeant Bellows, tucking the precious
      little paper under his blue gingham-covered pillow; &ldquo;not every boy would
      be so considerate as to think of that, but then it's a mighty nice berth
      for you, too. I'd give a good deal myself to live with the Bonifaces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are glad to go home, aren't you?&rdquo; Flutters asked, with some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt I shall be glad to see old England again, but once I've seen it
      that's all I care for. It's different with most of the men. Some of them
      can hardly speak for joy at the thought, and that makes some of the rest
      of us who haven't any homes to go to very wretched with&mdash;well I guess
      you'll have to call it not-any-home-sickness. It's half what is the matter
      with me to-day; and Andy there in the next bunk, who lost a wife and baby
      years ago in England, he'd a sight rather keep his back turned on
      everything that belongs to it. But there's no help for it. A soldier had
      best not have any will of his own, nor any preferences either, if he knows
      what's good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters did not know what reply to make to all this, though feeling very
      sorry for the old Sergeant, and so he began to button his coat together,
      and said: &ldquo;I guess I'd better go now. I hope I haven't made your headache
      any worse, Sergeant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you fear. It's done me good to talk with you, Flutters. It was more
      of a heartache than a headache, you know. I had one of those blue streaks,
      when a fellow feels he isn't of any use in the world; but if I can carry a
      message from you to your father 'way across the great ocean, I must be of
      a little use still, so I'll turn over and go to sleep as a sensible old
      codger should,&rdquo; and, suiting the action to the word, Sergeant Bellows
      rather unceremoniously &ldquo;turned over&rdquo; and pulled the gray army blanket half
      over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then,&rdquo; said Flutters, rising and taking the candle from the
      shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; yawned the Sergeant, as though already half asleep. &ldquo;I'll be
      up to the Captain's in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters set the lighted candle back where he had found it, and then made
      his way out as quietly as possible, and the moonbeams and the quiet once
      more had the room to themselves; and, unless thoughts were too active or
      hearts too heavy, there was no reason why Andy and the Sergeant should not
      have dropped off into the soundest of naps, at any rate, until the rest of
      the men should turn in an hour or two later, when there would, no doubt,
      be noise enough to wake the best of sleepers.

    <p>
      T was a comfort to have that matter off his mind, and, whatever might come
      of it, he had done the right thing. Such were Flutters's thoughts, as with
      hands plunged deep in his overcoat pockets, he started for home. To be
      sure, there was no knowing what might happen. What if his father should
      write to Captain Boniface and tell him that he (Flutters) was a naughty
      little runaway, and advise him to have nothing more to do with him? or
      suppose he should direct to have him sent right back to England, what
      would he do? Why, then, he thought he'd simply run away again, only that
      would not be an easy thing to do after having been treated so kindly by
      the Bonifaces. But, as he had himself told the Sergeant, it was not at all
      probable that this would happen; and so, like the logical little
      philosopher he was, he decided to think no more about it, and, if taking
      the advice of the old hymn, he &ldquo;gave to the <i>winds</i> his fears,&rdquo; it
      was no time at all before they were blown far behind him. During the half
      hour that he had spent with the Sergeant, a cold northwest blow had set
      in, making it far more comfortable for him to bend his head downward as he
      ran, and not take the wind full in his face. And this same northwest wind
      was playing all sorts of pranks with every pliable thing it could get hold
      of. The bare branches of the trees were swaying and crackling, withered
      leaves were swirling round in eddies and rustling loudly, gates were
      creaking on their rusty hinges, and, just as Flutters had reached a point
      in the road where an old hut stood, the blustering wind caught the only
      shutter remaining at one of its windows, and slammed it to with a bang
      that fairly made him jump. Looking toward the hut that had been deserted
      for years, Flutters saw a faint light shining out through the half of the
      window that was not screened by the closed shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's queer,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;who can be living there?&rdquo; and then, instead
      of running on without giving the matter another thought&mdash;as some
      boys, I think, would have done&mdash;he walked softly in at the gateway
      that had long lacked a gate, straight up to the window and peeped in; nor
      was it mere curiosity that prompted him to do it either. Flutters knew
      that no one, under ordinary circumstances, would be there; nothing short
      of utter homelessness would make anybody seek shelter in that wretched
      place, and so he felt the matter ought to be investigated, and he was not
      afraid to be the one to do it. And what do you suppose he saw through the
      broken pane? Something that would have made the tears come into almost
      anybody's eyes, but something that made Flutters's heart fairly stand
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only furniture of the room was a three-legged stool on which a bit of
      candle was spluttering, fastened to the stool by the melting of its own
      tallow, and there beside it, on a bundle of straw, lay an old man; and it
      took but one glance from Flutters's astonished eyes to see that the man
      was Bobbin, the old circus drudge. In another second he had pushed the
      door open and was kneeling at his friend's side, and stroking his cold,
      wrinkled hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who is it?&rdquo; asked Bobbin, in a cracked, weak voice; &ldquo;I can't rightly
      see, somehow, but it's good to know some one has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's me, Bobbin, don't you know me?&rdquo; said Flutters, scarcely able to
      speak with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright smile lighted up the old man's face. &ldquo;Ah! I thought He'd send
      somebody. He did send you, didn't He?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nobody sent me, Bobbin. I was just going by, and I saw the light, and
      I peeped in and then I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook his head, as much as to say that he believed that the
      good Father had sent him, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you were the one to come,&rdquo; he said, presently; &ldquo;there's nobody
      I'd rather have had than you, Flutters. You were always a kind little chap
      to old Bobbin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters did not say anything&mdash;he couldn't. He just pressed the
      wrinkled hand a little harder as it lay in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Flutters,&rdquo; said Bobbin, presently, &ldquo;I think I am going home
      to-night, and it was kind of lonely not to have somebody to care for me.
      Not that I mind going. I'm not a bit afraid, Flutters. I have done the
      best I could with the poor chance I had, and God will forgive the rest;
      don't you think so, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters nodded his head, and then he said in a moment, when he thought he
      could control his voice: &ldquo;But, Bobbin, I do not believe you are going to
      die. You need food and fire and clothes to warm you, and I am going right
      off to get them for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, please don't,&rdquo; pleaded the old man, putting what little strength
      he had into his hold on Flutters's hand. &ldquo;I don't want food nor anything.
      I just want to go, and it won't be long. Promise me you'll stay till
      morning, Flutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no gainsaying the entreaty in Bobbin's voice, and so Flutters
      said: &ldquo;I promise you, Bobbin;&rdquo; and, with a gratified sigh the old man
      turned on his side and soon fell asleep. After a while, when Flutters
      dared to move a little, he piled the loose straw that lay about him as
      closely as possible over Bobbin, and finally decided to dispense with his
      own warm coat, for the sake of stuffing it in the hole of the little
      paneless window through which the wind was keenly blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after another hour of motionless watching, during which Bobbin still
      lay sleeping as quietly as a child, it occurred to Flutters to try and
      make a fire in the blackened fireplace. Some old bits of board were lying
      in one corner of the room, and, piling them on the hearth, he easily
      succeeded in kindling them with a bundle of straw lighted at the candle.
      At first he was afraid that the crackling of the wood would waken the old
      man; but, undisturbed, he slept quietly on as though his mind was
      perfectly at rest, now that Flutters had come to care for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe he is going to die,&rdquo; thought Flutters, after he had
      again sat motionless for a long time, and then he crept close on hands and
      knees to look into his face, and to listen if he was breathing quite
      regularly; and there, bending over him, what did he see but something that
      made his heart bound for joy, though it was nothing but the corner of a
      little book showing itself above the ragged edge of one of Bobbin's
      pockets. And no wonder he was glad, for he knew in a moment that it was
      his own little Prayer-Book.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0185.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At first he thought he ought not to touch it for fear of waking
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbin, but how could he help it, and so, as gently as possible, he drew
      it out from its hiding-place, and crept back to the candle. I suppose we
      can hardly imagine what the finding of this old friend meant to Flutters.
      There was his own name on the fly-leaf, in his mother's writing, together
      with the date of his birth. Here was the proof, if he ever cared to use
      it, that he had once known a mother's love, and that was a deal more than
      some of the world's waifs could lay claim to, and besides, he loved the
      book for its own sake, for the beautiful words and thoughts that were in
      it. And to think Bobbin had kept it safe for him all these weeks; Flutters
      began to think that perhaps the Lord had sent him to Bobbin after all. And
      so he fell to wondering, as many an older head full often wonders, as to
      how much mere chance has to do with the happenings of this world, and how
      much the careful guiding of a Heavenly Father; but that the Father above
      has a great deal to do therewith is no longer a question in the minds of
      many of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime it was growing very late, for the clock on the town-hall was on
      the verge of striking twelve, and the moon was high over head. But Bobbin
      still slept on, and Flutters dared not leave him. What would Mrs. Boniface
      think, and how disappointed she would be to find that he was not to be
      trusted; but there was his promise to Bobbin, and he could not go, so he
      did the next best thing, he lay down by his side under the protection of
      the friendly straw and himself fell asleep, while the red-hot embers in
      the fireplace glowed and crackled as though anxious to make the place as
      comfortable as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobbin did not die that night; he woke with the first ray of sunlight that
      reached the hovel, but he found his faithful little watcher awake before
      him. Flutters thought he looked surprised, and perhaps a little
      disappointed, to find his eyes opening again in this world; at any rate he
      sighed a little wearily as he seemed slowly to realize where he was, then
      he looked up to Flutters's face and said, with a grateful smile, &ldquo;I knew
      you would keep your promise. I knew you would not leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will let me go <i>now</i>, Bobbin, won't you?&rdquo; said Flutters,
      with a world of entreaty in his voice, and wondering what he would do if
      Bobbin still proved obdurate; &ldquo;you see I haven't lived so very long with
      the Bonifaces, and they'll think I've run away, and be sorry they ever
      trusted me. I'll make up the fire before I go, and I'll be back soon and
      bring you something to eat and something perhaps to make you more
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, after what seemed to Flutters a long pause, &ldquo;I'll
      let you go, but not for long, mind that, Flutters; 'cause now that I can't
      do a thing for myself, I believe the Lord says, 'Flutters, you're to take
      care of old Bobbin till the time comes for me to take him away and care
      for him myself.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, too,&rdquo; answered Flutters, pushing the thin, gray hair back
      from the old man's forehead, and trying to make him look a little less
      unkempt and neglected, &ldquo;and never you fear but I'll do it, Bobbin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in a moment Flutters was gone, fairly flying home along the road, and
      when he reached the house not stopping so much as to say good-morning to
      old Dinah, who was opening the kitchen windows, and started back as though
      she had seen a ghost; but straight past her, and straight up to Captain
      Boniface's room. Mrs. Boniface slept on a little cot in the corner of the
      room nearest the door, and Flutters thought, and, as it proved, thought
      rightly, that he could give a gentle knock, and waken her without
      disturbing the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; asked a sweet, low voice, a voice whose every intonation
      Flutters had grown to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only me&mdash;Flutters,&rdquo; came the ungrammatical whisper, &ldquo;but I
      wanted you to know that I'm home all right. Nothing happened to me, but I
      came across an old friend of mine, and I had to stop and take care of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Boniface answered, not caring in the least
      that it was by no means customary to address little mulatto servant-boys
      in that familiar fashion. Like dear old Janet, in McDonald's beautiful
      story, Mrs. Boniface was &ldquo;one of <i>God's</i> mothers,&rdquo; with a mother-love
      broad enough and deep enough to shelter every little creature who, like
      Flutters, needed and longed for the protection of a brooding wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flutters sat down on the wood-box in the hall and waited, and in a moment
      Mrs. Boniface in her soft, blue wrapper, was seated beside him and he was
      outpouring with breathless eagerness the night's experiences, winding up,
      when all was told, with, &ldquo;and I promised to go back as soon as ever I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Flutters did go back as soon as he could, and Josephine and Hazel went
      with him; and food and clothing, and blankets and towels went too, and a
      dozen other things, such as any one would know would add greatly to the
      comfort of a sick old man who had lain down, as he thought, to die, in an
      empty and wretched dwelling. Later in the day, when some of the nearer
      neighbors had heard Bobbin's sad story, they were anxious, too, to do
      something for him, and before nightfall you would hardly have known the
      poor little shanty. One of them had sent a cot, and Bobbin had been lifted
      on to it; another, two or three chairs, one of which was a comfortable old
      rocker, and a third a table and some necessary cooking utensils. Indeed,
      Bobbin's story, as he narrated it to the little group gathered around him
      that morning after Flutters had found him, was sad enough to touch
      anybody's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kept on with the troupe,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;till we got almost to Albany,
      but I was getting weaker almost every day, and I missed Flutters
      dreadfully. I never knew till the boy was gone how much hard work he had
      saved me in one way and another. So at last, and just as I knowed it would
      be, the manager came to me one day and said, 'We ain't got no use for you
      any more, Bobbin. Ye can stay behind when we move on to-night.' An' I just
      looked him the eye an' said: 'All right, sir; but I'm wondering if you'll
      not be left behind when the Lord's own troupe moves on to the many
      mansions.' I knowed I ought not to have spoke like that, but there isn't a
      harder heart in the world than his, and that's the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do then, Bobbin?&rdquo; Josephine asked, as she sat beside him
      with tears of indignation standing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, right away I began to make my way back to Flutters; somehow I knew I
      should find him, only when I crawled into this hut last night after three
      weeks of being on the road, I thought it might not happen in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that Bobbin was made perfectly comfortable in the old
      shanty, for in those days there were no well-ordered Homes and Hospitals,
      for sick and homeless people, and Flutters, greatly to his heart's
      delight, was established as attendant-in-chief to his old friend.

    <p>
      LEAR and cool dawned the twenty-fifth of November, and, joy to the heart
      of every Whig, before nightfall not a member of the King's army would be
      left on American soil. Never, I ween, had the break of any day in New York
      found so large a number of its inhabitants awake to greet it. Too excited
      to sleep, with the thought of going home, were scores of English soldiers,
      and too excited to sleep, at the thought that they were soon to be rid of
      them, was well-nigh every loyal Whig throughout the length and breadth of
      the city. So, at a remarkably early hour there was an unwonted stir
      everywhere, and it seemed as though the very horses and cattle in their
      stalls must have divined that something remarkable was in the wind. But
      this great day of consummation had not arrived without weeks and months of
      active preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affairs in New York had been sadly mismanaged, and the arrival of Sir Guy
      Carleton, in the spring of 1782, had proved a precious boon, alike to Whig
      and Tory, and during the seventeen months intervening between his arrival
      and the evacuation, of the city, on this same twenty-fifth day of
      November, 1783, Sir Guy had had his hands full. One of the heaviest labors
      he had had to perform was the transporting of twelve thousand Loyalists
      from all parts of the colonies, to Nova Scotia, the Bahamas and Great
      Britain, for New York was not the only place where the offending Tories
      were made to feel, and very pointedly, too, that their room was considered
      vastly better than their company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But finally all was ready, the &ldquo;Royal Order&rdquo; to evacuate had arrived some
      two months before, and as soon as possible Sir Guy had named the day for
      departure. Now at last the day itself had come, and there was scarce a
      man, woman or child who had not planned to enter in some way into its
      festivities. But up at the Boniface's there was a strong conflict of
      feeling in one little Tory breast. Hazel was naturally in a &ldquo;perfect
      state,&rdquo; as girls say nowadays. It was most improper that she, an indignant
      little Loyalist, should be a witness to all that day's jubilation, and <i>yet</i>
      Starlight and Flutters and the Marberrys were going over to Bowery Lane to
      see the American troops march in from Harlem, and then into the city to
      see the English troops embark from Fort George, and were going to make a
      fine long day of it, and, after all, what good would it do anybody if she
      stayed at home? So it happened that Hazel's love of military bands and
      streamers and all sorts of public demonstration got the better even of her
      Tory principles, and after much urging on the part of the Marberrys (which
      she had felt from the first could be relied upon), she yielded, and Mrs.
      Boniface prepared a luncheon for <i>five</i>, instead of &ldquo;just for four,&rdquo;
       as Hazel had that morning directed. But none of the little party setting
      forth looked forward to the day's pleasure with quite so keen a relish as
      Flutters. He still remained quite neutral, not finding it easy, owing to
      his peculiar circumstances, to side either with Whig or Tory. So it did
      not matter much to him who were going or who were coming, the one dominant
      thought in his boyish heart simply being, that he was off for a day's fun,
      of which he had not had a great deal lately. For the last week he had been
      in constant attendance on old Bobbin, and before that there had been such
      very sad hearts in the Boniface household, owing to the Captain's illness.
      But for to-day Josephine had volunteered to care for Bobbin, and Bobbin
      himself had consented to spare Flutters, and so, free in every sense to
      give himself up to whatever enjoyment offered, Flutters was ready for &ldquo;a
      lark.&rdquo; And in just this very sort of thing, you boys and girls, who are
      like Flutters, set us older boys and girls an example, for boys and girls
      we are, all of us, in a way, so long as we keep a vestige of naturalness
      about us. Real sorrows may weigh down a child's spirit, and real trials
      beset him, but, give him the chance, even for an hour, to forget the
      sorrow and the trial, and he forgets it; and when God puts just such
      opportunities into all our lives, is it not for this very purpose of
      helping us to forget for a while?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boniface watched the five little friends file down the pathway,
      Flutters bringing up the rear with the capacious lunch-basket, and was
      thankful that there were pleasures, even in such unfavorable times, which
      children might enter into; and then, perhaps with thoughts akin to those
      we have been writing, about forgetting trouble, she turned with a bright
      smile to the Captain, and proposed that they should try and have a happy
      day too, unmindful of what was going on down in the city, and thankful for
      the serenity of their home, still left unmolested. And so Dinah was
      directed to prepare a favorite dish of the Captain's, and the Captain's
      favorite books were brought out, and Mrs. Boniface, resolutely putting
      aside every household claim, read aloud for two hours at a sitting, and
      then little Kate came in for a romp and had it, and at one o'clock Dinah
      brought in luncheon for all three on a great japanned tray, and they had a
      very cosey time eating it together. Who would have thought, to have looked
      in upon them, that Evacuation Day was, in point of fact, a very sorry day
      for the Boniface's?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the children gained the Bowery Road, mounted a rail fence in a
      row, like a flock of sparrows, and, with full as much chatter, waited for
      the coming of the troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0051" id="linkimage-0051"> </a>

      <a href="images/0192.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It seemed strange enough to everybody to think that the entire British
      Army, which had been scattered broadcast throughout the vicinity for so
      many years, was now congregated down in the city, and that before many
      hours there would not be a trace of it left. Hazel had certain
      apprehensions that it was going to seem very lonely without them, and when
      a small detachment of English soldiers marched past (the last of a company
      that had been quartered at Kings Bridge) and cheerily called out,
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Whiggies,&rdquo; to the children, as they sat on the fence, her heart
      entirely misgave her. Was it really loyal for her to be abroad on a day of
      such rejoicing, and how insulting to be called a &ldquo;Whiggie,&rdquo; when she was
      every whit as strong a Tory as the soldiers themselves. But just then the
      inspiring strains of an approaching band reached her, and the misgivings
      took to themselves wings. Nearer and nearer came the music, and soon
      Starlight recognized General Knox in command of two companies of American
      soldiers. They were marching into the city in compliance with a request of
      Sir Guy Carleton's, so as to be on hand in case of any disorder among the
      Whigs while the English were embarking. Now as soon as these American
      troops should have gotten out of the way, the Marberrys had planned a
      little surprise for the rest of the party, which they knew would prove a
      great addition to the day's pleasure. So, just as the children had begun
      to scramble down from the fence, with the intention of getting into the
      city as best they could, up drove old Jake, the Marberrys' coachman, with
      a farm wagon piled high with straw. &ldquo;Whoa! whoa, da!&rdquo; called Jake to the
      Rector's old black horse, and then, bowing and smiling, he said,
      importantly, &ldquo;At your sarvice for Evacuation Day, chilluns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course Hazel and Starlight and Flutters were delighted at this
      undreamed-of luxury, of being driven about all day, from one point of
      interest to another, and before they climbed into the wagon Hazel gave
      vent to her appreciation by giving both Milly and Tilly such a hug as sent
      the color flushing gratefully into the cheeks of those amiable little
      sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once in his life old Jake was in a thoroughly good humor, but it is
      extremely doubtful if anything short of all the pleasurable sensations of
      Evacuation Day could have brought about that delightful state of affairs.
      As for the children they were quite ready to do anything in the world for
      Jake, out of sheer gratitude for his kindly mood, a state of affairs, by
      the way, which should have made that old party feel very much ashamed of
      himself. To think that it should be such an unusual thing for a man to be
      kind, as to make even children open their eyes for wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible fully to describe all the varied enjoyment that that day
      held for the little party, although from the nature of things it was
      hardly to be expected that Hazel was able to get as much pleasure out of
      it as the others. Down into the city they went in the wake of General
      Knox's men, who came to a halt at the Collect, and then passing them, Jake
      took his stand at a point near Fort George, from which the children could
      watch the English soldiers file down into the barges and push off for the
      vessels lying at anchor in the Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes Company F,&rdquo; Starlight at last exclaimed, and in a moment the
      children tumbled out of the wagon, much to old Jake's astonishment, and in
      another moment were crowding round Sergeant Bellows, as he stood waiting
      his turn to step into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant had been up to the Boniface's for a more formal leave-taking
      the day before, but the children had promised to be on hand at the moment
      of departure, if they could in any wise manage it, and the Sergeant's face
      showed his delight, when he spied them come bounding toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in Hazel's eyes as the boat veered off from the dock, and
      tears in the Marberrys' eyes out of sympathy for Hazel, but of course the
      boys pretended they saw nothing whatever to feel sorry about. In the
      excitement, however, Flutters called out in a very significant tone,
      &ldquo;Don't you forget, Sergeant,&rdquo; and the Sergeant replied in rather a husky
      voice, &ldquo;Never you fear, my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo; questioned Hazel, feeling somehow that a little
      body-servant ought scarcely to have any private matters on hand. And then
      Flutters, realizing how foolish he had been to make public his affairs in
      that fashion, felt constrained to answer, &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; to Hazel's
      question, which disrespect on his part offended the dignity of his little
      mistress, and caused her to treat him with much coolness for the space of
      the next two minutes, at the end of which, however, she resumed her wonted
      manner, having forgotten by that time any reason for acting otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Company F had come about mid-way in the order of embarking, and as it
      neared one o'clock, the extreme rear guard began to file into the barges,
      while the American troops moved silently forward and took possession of
      the Fort, and then it was that General Knox, with a chosen few, galloped
      back to meet and escort General Washington and Governor Clinton into the
      city. For old Jake's party this in-between time seemed to offer the most
      favorable opportunity for luncheon, and with appetites keenly whetted by
      their long morning in the open air, the children &ldquo;fell to,&rdquo; and as soon as
      Jake had tied a bag of oats over black Jennie's head, he took his seat at
      the back of the wagon, and was himself regaled with a much larger portion
      of the Boniface luncheon than he in any wise deserved. If a body chances
      to be very hungry, and at the same time so fortunate as to have the
      wherewithal to satisfy that hunger, it is astonishing how absorbing the
      process of eating may become, and so I doubt if, for a while, the thoughts
      of the little company in the Rector's wagon, rose above the level of the
      biscuits they were enjoying or were otherwise occupied than with the great
      acceptableness of cookies, apple jelly, and some other inviting edibles;
      and yet, only think! this was the 25th of November, 1783. Out there beyond
      them on the broad sunshine of the Bay, the last of the English Army were
      turning their backs upon America, and above them toward Harlem, a large
      company of loyal Americans were joyfully forming into rank and file to
      take public possession of the city so dearly loved, and that had been for
      years under English rule. Yes, American history was making very fast
      during that eventful November noontide, and yet so imperative are the
      demands of poor human nature, that even such a thorough-going little Whig
      as Starlight became for the time being so deeply absorbed in bread and
      cheese as to grow unmindful of exultant Whigs and departing Tories.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the luncheon was all disposed of, save a few crumbs thrown over
      the wagon side to a stray dog, who had long been beseechingly eying the
      children, their minds at once reverted to matters of general importance,
      and it was decided to drive back to some point on Broadway from which they
      could watch the procession, and Jennie was urged into a clumsy canter by
      way of making up for lost time. As it was they had some difficulty in
      gaining even a fair position on the line of march, and secured that none
      too soon, for the sound of music in the distance was growing more and more
      distinct, and in another second the head of the procession came into view.
      And what a procession it proved! although there was no show of military
      pomp or glory. That was quite impossible, since the greater part of the
      American Army had already been disbanded, and those that were left to
      participate in the day's jubilation owned nothing better than shabby
      uniforms which had seen hard service, and in many cases even these poor
      remnants had need to be supplemented with coats or trousers of most
      unmilitary aspect.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0196.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      But, notwithstanding all this, it was a grand procession. General
      Washington and Governor Clinton on horseback, followed by their suites,
      were at its head; then came the Lieutenant Governor and the members of the
      Legislature; following them, the officers of the army, and a large body of
      prominent citizens, and lastly the military, whose very shabbiness,
      because of its significance, served but to add to the interest they
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting behind the New Jersey hills before the procession was
      truly over, and then, as there was nothing more to be seen, and they were
      thoroughly weary besides, the children assented to Jake's proposition to
      turn Jennie's head homeward. When they neared the vicinity of old Bobbin's
      shanty, Flutters crept to the back of the wagon prepared to drop at the
      right moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Flutters going?&rdquo; asked the Marberrys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has to take care of old Bobbin, now,&rdquo; Hazel explained with a sigh;
      &ldquo;but you 'can't imagine how inconvenient it is for me,&rdquo; for her ladyship
      had taken very kindly to this having a willing little servant at her beck
      and call. Rather too kindly, Mrs. Boniface thought, and she was not sorry
      to have Flutters's time so fully-occupied as to leave none of it at
      Hazel's disposal. Soon after Flutters's departure the little party relaxed
      into silence, talked out and tired out, and as Jake showed some signs, now
      that the excitement of the day was over, of resuming his wonted surliness,
      Starlight and Hazel were not the least sorry when old Jennie, in the
      perfect stillness of the early November twilight, came to a standstill at
      the Boniface gate.

    <p>
      OSEPPIINE had stood in the doorway of the little cottage half a dozen
      times within the last hour peering anxiously down the road in search of
      Flutters, and now that she discovered him coming cross-cut through the
      meadow near which he had left the wagon, no one could have told how
      relieved she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Flutters, I'm so glad you've come!&rdquo; she called softly, as soon as he
      came within speaking distance, and then immediately turned back into the
      room. Flutters followed her on tip-toe, for she had motioned him to come
      in quietly. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked, going close to Bobbin's cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don t know,&rdquo; Josephine whispered, with tears of anxious sympathy
      filling her gray eyes; &ldquo;we had had a lovely talk together, and then he
      asked me to read out of a book, your Prayer-Book, he said it was, and so I
      read ever so many psalms from the Psalter, till suddenly looking up I saw
      that he was in great pain, and when I spoke to him he seemed neither to
      see nor hear me. In a little while the pain passed over, and ever since he
      has lain there so still that I have had to put my ear down very close to
      make sure that he was breathing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Bobbin,&rdquo; said Flutters, stroking the thin gray hair. The
      well-known voice, or perhaps the gentle touch, seemed to rouse him, for he
      slowly opened his eyes and seeing Flutters, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not try to keep me this time,&rdquo; he said slowly, looking up at
      Flutters beseechingly, but in a voice too low and weak for even Josephine
      to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said not to try to keep him this time,&rdquo; Flutters explained, &ldquo;but don't
      you think I ought to go right away for a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobbin moved his head entreatingly from side to side, so Josephine said:
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps not yet, Flutters, he seems so much more comfortable now,&rdquo;
       whereupon Bobbin looked the thanks he felt. After a while, when he had
      once again mustered strength, he said: &ldquo;Flutters, the little book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters, knowing well enough what he meant, took the Prayer-Book which
      had been soon restored to Bobbin after that night when he had first
      joyfully discovered it, and turning to the selections for the twenty-fifth
      day of the month began to read. Josephine drew a chair to the fireplace
      and sat listening, with her hands folded in her lap, while Bobbin never
      took his eyes from Flutters's face, as he sat close beside him so that he
      might hear distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little hut looked very cheery and cosey, converted as it had been into
      such a comfortable shelter, more comfortable indeed than Bobbin had ever
      known, and at a time, too, when a warm room and a quiet one meant more to
      him than it could have meant at anytime in all his life before. But the
      light in the room was momentarily growing more and more dim, and Flutters
      had to hold the book high in his hand toward the little window in order to
      see at all. Gradually Bobbin's tired eyes closed, and the last words that
      fell on his ears were these: &ldquo;My soul has longed for Thy salvation and I
      have a good hope because of Thy Word. Mine eyes long sore for Thy Word,
      saying, Oh, when wilt Thou comfort me?&rdquo; Flutters finished the selection
      and looked up. &ldquo;Miss Josephine!&rdquo; was all he found words to say, but both
      of them knew in a moment that in very truth &ldquo;Evacuation Day&rdquo; had come for
      Bobbin too, evacuation from all the sorrows of a long, hard life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sorry,&rdquo; said Josephine, looking down on the calm face from which
      all the care seemed at once to have vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Flutters, &ldquo;but he was such a good friend to me when no one
      else cared,&rdquo; and then, unable to keep the tears back, he laid his arm on
      Bobbin's bed, and burying his face upon it, cried bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something sacred about this deep sense of personal loss that was
      finding vent in Flutters's hot tears, and for a while Josephine hesitated
      to intrude upon it. She moved quietly about the room setting its few
      little articles to rights, and then when there was nothing else to be
      done, and Flutters had gotten himself somewhat in hand, she sat down by
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about Bobbin's history, Flutters?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; trying to master the emotion that made it difficult to speak;
      &ldquo;he never liked to talk about himself, but he told me once he had always
      been sort of alone ever since he could remember, and that he hadn't a
      relative in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterward, Bobbin was laid away in a corner of the little
      cemetery surrounding St. George's Church, Mr. Marberry having gained the
      consent of the Vestry to have him buried there. Mr. Marberry read the
      service from Flutters's own Prayer-Book, and about the grave of the old
      man whose life had been so lonely, gathered at the last a little company
      of loving friends. It seemed to Flutters as if, with Bobbin's death, the
      chapter of his life that had to do with the wretched circus had been
      forever closed, but, oh, how thankful he was to have been able to make so
      calm and peaceful the last days of the only friend it had ever given him.
      Once again the road-side cottage was dismantled of everything that made it
      homelike, and as the bleak wintry winds whistled round and through it, who
      would have thought that such a little while ago an old man had been
      comfortably housed there, and that it was only now left tenantless,
      because its occupant no longer had need of any earthly shelter.

    <p>
      VACUATION DAY, with all its excitement, was soon followed by that day well
      nigh as eventful, when on the Fourth of December General Washington took
      final leave of his officers &ldquo;in the great historic room&rdquo; at Fraunces
      Tavern, a leavetaking that proved a very touching and trying ordeal both
      for him and for them. Starlight and Flutters, who had contrived to be in
      the forefront of the crowd that looked on, could have told you how plainly
      strong emotion was betrayed on the brave General's face, as he passed out
      from the tavern, and down to the barge that was waiting to convey him to
      Paulus Hook on his way to Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after that day, affairs settled down into much quieter channels than
      they had known for some time&mdash;that is, at any rate as far as the
      people with whom we have most to do are concerned. The Van Vleets had
      asked Aunt Frances to make her home with them indefinitely, and though
      still faintly cherishing the hope that she might have her own home back
      again some day, she had accepted their invitation, and opened a little
      school among the farmers' children in the neighborhood. Starlight was one
      of her most promising pupils, and so his visits to Kings Bridge were of
      necessity less frequent than they used to be. In that matter, Cousin Harry
      had a great advantage over him, for having moved to New York in order to
      be near his office, what more natural, and, as Harry would have said,
      &ldquo;what more delightful,&rdquo; than to spend all his evenings at the Bonifaces?
      And what a blessing those visits were to them, only they themselves could
      have told you. As soon as he arrived he would first go upstairs and have a
      talk with the Captain, ransacking his mind for everything that could by
      any possibility interest him; then when he had told the little or much
      that he had to tell, or saw that he was tiring him, down he would go to
      the sitting-room, have a romp with Bonny Kate, if she had managed to stay
      up past her bed-time, or possibly a game of some sort with Hazel and
      Flutters, but it generally happened that after a while there was no one
      left to talk to save Josephine, and of course you know better than to
      think that Harry minded that. Josephine had generally some bit of work in
      hand, and could not afford to simply laugh and chat the evening away, with
      her pretty hands lying idle in her lap, as perhaps is the case with your
      older sister, when some friend comes to call. No, indeed! it was necessary
      in those days for her to stitch, and stitch industriously in every
      available moment, if the Boniface needs were to be in any wise met; nor
      did these two young people laugh and chat very much either&mdash;the times
      were rather too serious for that; not that they did not have a happy time
      of it, and sometimes were actually merry, but, as a rule, they seemed to
      have something of importance to quietly talk over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the winter came and went, and spring began to be felt in the air,
      and an occasional early bird note, or a bunch of pussy willow by the
      road-side, bore witness to the fact that it was slowly but surely coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had seemed a long, long winter to Mrs. Boniface. For many weeks she had
      lived the most retired life possible. Few had come to see her, and there
      were but one or two friends left whom she cared to go and see. If it had
      not been for Harry Avery, they would scarce have had any communication
      with the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no further threats made against Captain Boniface. Even the
      most bitter of his enemies would hardly have found it in his heart to
      persecute a man who was so hopelessly paralyzed as never to be able to
      walk again; but there was something very significant in the fact that they
      simply left him alone. None of them in a relenting spirit had called to
      inquire how he was, and if any of the old friends, who had treated him so
      cruelly that night at the Assembly, ever felt ashamed of their behavior,
      they never had the grace to own it. Indeed, it is terrible to think how
      that great mastering passion, which we proudly call patriotism, sometimes
      seems to smother every noble and natural impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the Assembly, in fact that very night, Captain Boniface had
      told his wife of the murders in South Carolina, and it seemed to her then
      as though every spark of sympathy with the colonies and colonial interests
      had that moment died within her. She was by far too noble to let actual
      hatred take its place; but she longed with all her heart for old England,
      where she had been born, and to turn her back on this new country which
      had treated her so harshly. So Mrs. Boniface waited, with no little
      anxiety, for the arrival of the long-looked-for letter, cherishing the
      fervent hope that her father would send for them all to come to him,
      planning thoughtfully all the details of their journey, and yet never once
      daring to put her hope into words. It might happen that, although willing
      enough to help them, he would not propose to do it by having her little
      family sweep down upon him and rob the old rectory of the quiet it had
      known so long, and which must be very grateful to him in his old age. But
      at last the letter came, and Mrs. Boniface straightway carried it off to
      Flutters's room, and closed the door and locked it. Her hands trembled as
      she broke the seal. What were they to do? that was the question that had
      anxiously confronted her for several long, weary months; but always she
      had simply to postpone any attempt to answer it, waiting for this letter;
      and now it was in her hand what would it tell her?
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved to be a long, long letter, and she read it slowly through, word
      by word; then she buried her face in her hands and cried; but sometimes
      people cry for joy and not for sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon of the same day, Flutters was grooming
    </p>
    <p>
      Gladys in the barn, accompanying the process with a queer, buzzing noise,
      such as I believe is quite common to grooming the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters, where are you?&rdquo; called Hazel, coming into the barn in search of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here with Gladys, Miss Hazel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Flutters?&rdquo; and then Hazel climbed up and seated
      herself on the edge of Gladys's trough, before adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0055" id="linkimage-0055"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0205.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to England to live with grandpa. Mother says he's just the
      dearest old man, and he's sent for us all to come. He lives in a lovely
      rectory in Cheshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it, Miss Hazel!&rdquo; said Flutters, his breath quite taken
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course you will go with me, Flutters. Mother says you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very kind of you to be willing to take me,&rdquo; Flutters managed to
      reply, but at the same time realized that he would do almost anything
      rather than go back to England, and to the very same county, too, from
      which he had come; and he leaned down, apparently to brush some straw from
      one of Gladys's legs, but really to hide the tears of bitter
      disappointment that had sprung unbidden into his eyes. Fortunately, the
      ruse succeeded very well, Hazel never dreaming but what he was as
      delighted with the news as she herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how glad I am to go, Flutters, although mother says we
      probably never should have gone, if it had not been for father's illness.
      Things are getting so much quieter now that she thinks people would have
      let us alone, and father could, perhaps, have found some way to make a
      living, because, you see, we haven't much money left since the war; but
      you knew that, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters sort of half nodded yes, seeing that something was expected of
      him, but he was not paying close attention to what Hazel was saying. How
      could he bear to have them go and leave him alone in America, and whatever
      should he do? were the thoughts that were filling his mind. It seemed as
      though every hair on Gladys's back was bristling with the same sad
      questions, and then the thought came to him that Gladys herself would
      probably be left behind, too, and he laid his hand affectionately on her
      prettily arched neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to live in a King's country,&rdquo; Hazel resumed, after a
      little pause, &ldquo;and not where everybody's as good as everybody else, and
      where they don't have princes and princesses, and lovely palaces for them
      to live in. But there's one thing I mean to do as soon as ever I reach
      there, and that is, to get presented at Court, and tell King George how
      the prisoners were treated on the 'Jersey,' He ought to know about it, and
      when he does, I just guess those men will get the punishment they
      deserve;&rdquo; and her cheeks glowed with excitement at the thought of the
      forthcoming interview. &ldquo;Flutters, do you know anything about the South of
      England&mdash;about Cheshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something,&rdquo; answered Flutters, getting a little better command of
      himself. &ldquo;In what part of it does your grandfather live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feltstone, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flutters gave a sigh of relief. Feltstone was several miles from Burnham,
      his old home, but it wasn't worth while to think of that; for back to
      England he would not go. To be sure, there was a chance that if Sergeant
      Bellows had found his father that he might be sent for; but he could not
      bear to face that alternative, and would not till he had to. And then,
      wondering if he ever would hear from the Sergeant, he remembered that he
      had half-hoped and half-feared that the &ldquo;Blue Bird,&rdquo; which had brought
      Mrs. Boniface's letter, would also bring one for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was to be expected, Hazel chatted on with much volubility about the
      numerous arrangements for the coming journey, and how they would all have
      to try to make everything as comfortable as possible for her father. Now
      and then she felt conscious of a lack of enthusiasm on Flutters's part,
      but the thought was only momentary, and her active little mind at once
      travelled off in some new line of delightful anticipation. All Flutters
      had to do was occasionally to answer a question. He thought best not to
      say anything to Hazel about not going with them until he should have
      talked with Mrs. Boniface. Meantime Gladys's grooming was completed, and
      as her pretty mane had been plaited by Hazel, as she talked, into half a
      dozen tight braids, she looked quite as prim and trig as a little old maid
      on a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go up to the house, now,&rdquo; said Hazel; &ldquo;or, no, I'll tell you, let's
      go up to the Marberrys and tell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't go, Miss Hazel; your mother said she had something for me to do
      in the house.&rdquo; Whereupon Hazel pouted a little, thinking it more fitting,
      no doubt, that body-servants should obey their mistresses rather than
      their mistresses' mothers, but at the same time seeing that it was useless
      for her to contend against the force of circumstances, which in those days
      of much to do and few to do it, made Flutters a most useful member of the
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the Marberrys, now,&rdquo; she cried, discovering them coming in at
      the gate in their usual two-abreast fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flutters,&rdquo; cried Milly, as they both broke into a little run, &ldquo;here's a
      letter for you; it came up with our mail by mistake.&rdquo; Flutters reached for
      it eagerly. >
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's directed just 'Flutters,' care of Captain Boniface,&rdquo; ventured Tilly;
      &ldquo;that's queer, isn't it? Haven't you any other name, Flutters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; was Flutters's rather remarkable answer, and then he ran back
      to the barn as if he had forgotten something important, but really,
      because, like Mrs. Boniface, he did not want to have any one &ldquo;round&rdquo; when
      he read his letter. He chose, too, to take his seat just where Hazel had
      been sitting, before he opened it. Gladys looked on with wide-eyed pony
      astonishment at this unwonted appropriation of her own individual stall,
      but seemed, notwithstanding, to regard the matter good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were feasible to have schools for ponies, and Gladys had had the
      benefit thereof, and at the same time no better manners than to have
      looked over Flutters's shoulder, this is what she might have read &ldquo;just as
      easy as anything,&rdquo; as you children say:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bunch of Grapes,
    </p>
    <p>
      Burnham, Cheshire, England,
    </p>
    <p>
      February 23d, 1784.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Flutters: As perceived by the heading of this letter, I write from
      the inn in your father's village, to which place I made haste to journey
      so soon as I was favored with my furlough. And now, my dear Flutters, I
      have sad news to break to you, and for which you must nerve yourself, like
      the plucky little fellow that you are. Your good father is no longer a
      sojourner in this sad world of ours. He died after a very short illness,
      on the third of last September. I went to see his widow, told her I had
      some knowledge of you, and that if your father had left any message I
      would send it to you. She said she could not remember any, save that he
      used sometimes to say that he would like to know if you were well cared
      for. She does not seem to have as much heart as most women, and blest if I
      blame you much for running off as you did. I think your father left very
      little money, as folks say that your stepmother will have to do something
      to support herself and her children. Wishing I had better news to send
      you, Flutters, and with my dutiful respects to the dear Bonifaces, I close
      this letter&mdash;the longest I ever wrote in my life&mdash;and I hope
      never again to be obliged to write such another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours dutifully,
    </p>
    <p>
      R. A. Bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gladys,&rdquo; cried Flutters, when he had finished reading, and, leaning
      his head against the pony's head, he sobbed aloud. Such a whirl of emotion
      as that letter awoke for Flutters could not be put into words, and in his
      imagination he seemed to see his fathers grave and old Bobbin's side by
      side. The Bonifaces were all he had left now, and they, they were going to
      leave him; but, no, and a new light seemed to flash in on his mind&mdash;what
      was there now to hinder his going with them? His stepmother would never
      claim him. Indeed, she need never know he was in England, and so there was
      a bright side to Flutters's sorrow, and after a while he walked quietly
      out from the barn with the Sergeant's letter in his hand, and straight to
      Mrs. Boniface, whom he found in the Captain's room, and then and there he
      told them all his story, and after the telling felt he was even nearer and
      dearer to his new friends than ever he had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Gladys ever knew how intense had been Flutters's first sorrow on
      reading the Sergeant's letter, but she was such a harum-scarum pony that
      probably the memory of it went out of her head full as quickly as the
      hairs, wet by Flutters's tears, dried on her forehead.

    <p>
      OOD news or sorrowful news does not always come to one in the form of a
      carefully worded letter, as with Mrs. Boniface and Flutters, nor when,
      because a letter of some sort is expected, one is in a way prepared for
      it. More often it comes when you are least on the lookout for it, and when
      life is running on uneventfully in worn grooves, as though it must so run
      on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this same unanticipated fashion some very good news came to Aunt
      Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at sunset, and she was out on the river in a little boat with
      Starlight. It had been one of those days that sometimes come in the latter
      part of May as harbingers of summer. The school-room had been close and
      warm, and Aunt Frances had left it with a headache, so that Starlight,
      with a loving thoughtfulness that always went straight to her heart, had
      proposed a row in the cool, early-evening air of the river, and Aunt
      Frances had accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not row hard, dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;just paddle around leisurely not far
      from the shore. I like it just as well;&rdquo; and Starlight, who also felt a
      little enervated by the languid day, was glad to take her at her word.
      Indeed, none of the people of this little story were feeling very bright
      and cheery just then. 'Rather heavy-hearted,' would have described them
      all in greater or less degree, and the fact that the Bonifaces were going
      away had much to do therewith. Even Hazel's rosy anticipations of life
      under Old England's glorious monarchy, paled a little, as she realized
      that such dear friends as Aunt Frances, Starlight, and the Marberrys must
      be left behind, as well as everything else familiar to her childhood. It
      had been decided that the Bonifaces should sail in the &ldquo;Blue Bird,&rdquo; when
      she returned to England in the middle of June, and the sight of her, as
      she lay at anchor in the harbor, was such a depressing one to Starlight,
      that he contrived, as they rowed about on the river, to keep his back
      turned toward her as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is really settled, Starlight, that the Bonifaces are going?&rdquo; said
      Aunt Frances, looking over toward the ship, and breaking a long pause,
      during which they had both sat thoughtfully silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Starlight answered resting on his oars. &ldquo;I feel awfully sorry for
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not sorry for themselves, are they?&rdquo; and Aunt Frances
      drawing up her sleeve put her hand over the boat's side that the cool
      water might splash against it. &ldquo;I imagined that Mrs. Boniface was glad to
      go back to England and to her father, whom she has not seen since she was
      married, twenty-five years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course, she is glad on some accounts, but after all they go
      because they must; and, besides, it's hard to go back to the country you
      came from without having made a success of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the war is entirely responsible for all the Captain's troubles&mdash;everybody
      knows that well enough, and if any one deserves a pension from the Crown
      he certainly does. He has sacrificed health and friends and property in
      the service of the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Starlight, &ldquo;and it's a cruel shame that people like the
      Bonifaces shouldn't be treated decently, and that people like us, Aunt
      Frances, shouldn't be allowed to live in the houses that belong to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh&mdash;, Starlight,&rdquo; said Aunt Frances, &ldquo;there are some things you know
      that it is better not to talk about any more; it only stirs us up and to
      no purpose;&rdquo; whereupon Starlight obediently lapsed into silence, and
      nothing more was said till Aunt Frances, discovering a row-boat in the
      middle of the river, coming toward them, exclaimed, &ldquo;Who's that, I
      wonder!&rdquo; for boats were not so numerous in those days as to come and go
      without notice. Starlight wondered too, but continued to row about in an
      aimless fashion, till first thing they knew the approaching boat was quite
      close upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; said Aunt Frances, softly, and Starlight had only time to
      reply, &ldquo;It looks a little like Captain Wadsworth,&rdquo; and Aunt Frances to see
      that he was right in his conjecture, before the boat came within speaking
      distance, and the Captain, touching his hat, said politely, &ldquo;Miss Avery, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain Wadsworth;&rdquo; for although Aunt Frances and the Captain had
      never before exchanged words, their faces were well known to each other.
      &ldquo;Did you wish to see me?&rdquo; she added, somewhat coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was too much of a gentleman to show that he noticed her
      chilling manner, and remarked quite casually, &ldquo;I merely came over to tell
      you that I have decided after all to give up the idea of making my home in
      this country, and that your home is at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Aunt Frances, unable to believe that she heard
      aright. As for Starlight, he lost an oar overboard from sheer excitement,
      which the man who was rowing Captain Wadsworth was kind enough to fish out
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;that you are free to enter your own home at
      once; I propose to sail for England very soon and have already vacated
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; for Aunt Frances was more confused than she had
      ever been in her life. &ldquo;I can pay nothing for it. If you consider that you
      have a right to live in it, you must consider that you also have a right
      to sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain bit his lip, at a loss what to say, and Aunt Frances realized
      that she was acting unkindly and perhaps rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that there is nothing for me to do but simply
      to walk into my old home?&rdquo; and her face brightened unconsciously as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I mean, Miss Avery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, Captain Wadsworth. You can hardly wonder, I am sure,
      that I cannot find words in which to thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you thank me?&rdquo; the Colonel replied half mischievously. &ldquo;You
      have felt all along that the place rightfully belonged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had the law on your side, so what did it matter how I thought or
      felt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It mattered a great deal, Miss Avery; so much that, law on my side or no,
      I confess to you that I have not felt very comfortable in your home,
      particularly since I moved my men out, and have had the place to myself.
      Indeed, I've never really felt at home in the country, and half regret
      having resigned my commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can imagine that all this is a great surprise to me,&rdquo; said Aunt
      Frances, never looking handsomer in her life, &ldquo;though I acknowledge having
      cherished just a faint little hope lately that it might come about some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why lately, if I may ask, Miss Avery?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Aunt Frances, blushing a little, &ldquo;Colonel Hamilton told me
      at the Assembly that he was sorry to have been the means of depriving me
      of my home, and that he would endeavor to make any reparation within his
      power. Will you think me rude in asking if he has in any way influenced
      your decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Hamilton? No, not in the least; but I believe the arguments of a
      certain little woman, who came to me several months ago, have had much to
      do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who it was,&rdquo; exclaimed Starlight, eagerly, unable to keep silent
      another moment; &ldquo;I believe it was Hazel Boniface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe you are her friend, 'Starlight,'&rdquo; said the Captain, having
      made up his mind to that fact much earlier in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starlight said &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; with a beaming look which plainly declared that
      he was proud to have that honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Peter, the Captain's man, had sat an interested listener,
      enjoying everything with much the same relish perhaps as you or I would
      enjoy the happy ending of a rather harrowing play, only this was by so
      much the better, because it was real and not &ldquo;make believe.&rdquo; To keep the
      boats from drifting apart, Peter kept a firm hand upon the rail of
      Starlight's boat, and Starlight's upon his. Indeed, I think there was a
      tacit understanding between them that on no account were those two boats
      to be allowed to diverge a hair's-breadth until this whole delightful
      matter should be unalterably settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Starlight's remark about Hazel had been another surprise to Aunt
      Frances, and when Captain Wadsworth went on to tell her all about Hazel's
      call in the warm September weather of the preceding autumn, and how deep a
      hold her childish earnestness had taken upon him, it seemed to Aunt
      Frances as though she could not wait to give her successful little
      champion such a hug as she had never had in her life before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went to see Colonel Hamilton too,&rdquo; said Starlight in the pause that
      followed Captain Wadsworth's narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps that partly accounts for Colonel Hamilton's kind feeling,&rdquo;
       said Aunt Frances slowly, as a new light seemed to shine in upon the whole
      transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it highly probable, Miss Avery. The old prophecy that a little
      child shall lead them is more often fulfilled, even in this world, I
      think, than most of us have any idea of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the current of the river had carried the boats close into shore,
      and Aunt Frances, with the charm of manner that was always natural to her,
      asked the Captain to come up to the house, and he came up, and accepted
      the Van Vleets' cordial invitation to stay to supper, and not until the
      moon was high over the river did he call to Peter to row him back to New
      York; and if the Colonel's body had grown as light as his heart, old
      Peter's load would have been scarce heavier than a feather.

    <p>
      O, Starlight, I'm sorry, but I do not see how you can possibly be of the
      least use in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lewis tried to speak kindly, but, big boy or no, real tears stood
      in Starlights eyes. &ldquo;Why, do you feel as badly as that, Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starlight gave a nod which meant that he did feel just as badly as that,
      and at the same time succeeded in choking down what he feared might have
      proved an audible little sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let me see,&rdquo; and the Captain leaned forward on his rude desk
      and thought a moment. They were in the cabin of the &ldquo;Blue Bird,&rdquo; whither
      Starlight had rowed over that morning, with such a favor to ask of the
      &ldquo;Blue Bird's&rdquo; Captain as he never yet had asked of anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you <i>could</i> do little odds and ends for me now, couldn't
      you?&rdquo; continued the Captain, after what seemed to Starlight a never-ending
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered frankly, brushing away his tears with his sleeve
      in awkward boy fashion; &ldquo;I'm sure I could save you ever so many steps. You
      know I wouldn't think of going unless I really felt I could work my
      passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a proud little fellow, Job, but, then, I like your spirit, and if
      you won't take the voyage as a cabin passenger at my invitation, why,
      then, you shall go as you propose. Of course your Aunt has given her
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not asked her yet, sir. I thought it would be half the battle to
      have your permission first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed heartily over Starlight's diplomacy, and then they
      talked on for a quarter of an hour longer, arranging the details of the
      journey that was to be, if only Aunt Frances could be persuaded to give
      her consent&mdash;a pretty big if, by the way. At the end of that time
      Starlight, remembering that the Captain must have many things to attend
      to, said good-afternoon, shaking his rough sailor hand with a world of
      gratitude in his happy face. Then he clambered nimbly down the &ldquo;Blue
      Bird's&rdquo; ladder, and jumping into his boat, rowed off toward New York and
      toward home, for, scarcely able to believe their senses, Aunt Frances and
      Starlight were back in the old house, with everything so nearly restored
      to what it had been before that those two years in the Van Vleet homestead
      already seemed half a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the 15th of June had dawned, and as the &ldquo;Blue Bird&rdquo; was to sail
      that afternoon, everything was in readiness for the departure of the
      Bonifaces, and everything was in readiness for something else, too, which
      was nothing more nor less than a wedding at Aunt Frances's. And who do you
      suppose were going to be married? Who, to be sure, but Josephine and
      Harry, and Josephine was to stay in America, and her home was to be right
      there in the old house with Aunt Frances. Strange, wasn't it, that she
      should be willing to stay behind, when all the family were going away
      across the ocean to live in England? But that is one of the things that is
      often happening in this queer world of ours, and the beauty of it is that
      it is all right and beautiful, and just as the good Father Himself would
      have it. And so Josephine was married at noon in Aunt Frances's parlor,
      and even her father was there, for it had been arranged that the ceremony
      should be performed when the Bonifaces were on their way to the &ldquo;Blue
      Bird,&rdquo; and when it would be an easy matter simply to carry the Captain in
      and lift him on to the broad lounge in the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something sad in the fact that, so strong was party feeling
      everywhere, that it had been difficult to find in the neighborhood the
      four men needed to accomplish the moving of Captain Boniface into the city
      and then out to the ship; four men, that is, who did not feel that they
      had some sort of grudge against the English officer. But Jake, the
      Marberrys' man, had at last pressed into the service three others of his
      race, who bore Captain Boniface no ill-will. It was touching to see with
      what tender care the four strong fellows lifted their helpless burden, for
      although the Captain had recovered, as Dr. Melville said he would, partial
      use of his arms and hands, he was still powerless to take a single step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marberry naturally officiated at the wedding, and the twins, of
      course, were there, smiling and sweet, though possibly a little
      self-conscious, in their new white dresses, with soft silk sashes, tied in
      two exactly similar bows in the middle of their straight little backs. And
      the Van Vleets were there, and Miss Pauline, who looked rather mystified
      at the whole proceeding, and Captain Wadsworth besides, and Colonel and
      Mrs. Hamilton, the two latter of whom were invited because of Harry's
      position in the Colonel's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubtless a real satisfaction to Captain Wadsworth and Colonel
      Hamilton to be present, though, when you come to think of it, it was
      rather a remarkable state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were attending a wedding in the very house that they had
      lawfully succeeded in wresting from Miss Avery, and here she was
      permanently established in her own home again, with the Captain out of it,
      and of his own accord too. It was strange indeed how it had all come
      about, and stranger still to think that a little girl of ten, mustering up
      sufficient courage to call upon two strange gentlemen several months
      before, had had much to do with bringing about this delightful change in
      affairs; but, as we all hear so often that we do not half take in the
      blessed truth of it, &ldquo;God's ways are not as our ways,&rdquo; and the trifles, as
      we think them, are likely to prove anything but trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than a delight to Harry to have Colonel Hamilton present at
      his wedding, for although his employer was his senior by only a few years,
      Harry looked up to him with an admiring veneration amounting almost to
      worship. There was something about Alexander Hamilton that inspired this
      sort of devotion, an air, some have said, of serious, half-sad
      thoughtfulness, as though the cruel and unnecessary sacrifice of his life,
      which he felt in honor bound to make in 1804, cast long shadows of
      presentiment before it.

    <p>
      When the ceremony was over, and Hazel had been the first to press the
      lovingest sort of a kiss on Josephine's lips, all the rest gathered around
      to congratulate the young couple, trying for the moment to forget the
      sorrowful parting so soon to follow. Then when they had eaten, or
      pretended to eat, some of the good things Aunt Frances had prepared in
      honor of the occasion, it was time to go down to the barge that was
      waiting at Fort George to carry the &ldquo;Blue Bird's&rdquo; passengers. Josephine's
      good-byes were all said at the house. She could not bear to have any
      strangers near when she took that long farewell of her father and mother,
      and Hazel and Bonny Kate, and then, going up to the room that Aunt Frances
      had fitted up for her, and burying her face in the pillows of the sofa, it
      seemed to her as though her heart would break. Sad enough for a bride, you
      think&mdash;so different from all the joyous cheer that ought to belong to
      a wedding; and yet many happy days were in store for Josephine, many happy
      years in the old homestead, never so homelike and attractive as since Aunt
      Frances had regained possession of it. There was quite a little company of
      them walking down to the barge, so much of a company, indeed, that some
      boys, who noticed them, wondered &ldquo;what was up,&rdquo; and having nothing better
      to do, followed in their train. Captain Boniface, of course, was driven
      down, and so was Mrs. Boniface and Kate; but Hazel preferred to walk, and
      with a &ldquo;teary&rdquo; little Marberry on either arm made her way along with the
      rest. There was but one bright spot on the otherwise dark horizon of those
      little Marberrys, and that was that Hazel's pony, Gladys, had taken up her
      abode in the Rector's stable, and was to be theirs from that day forth;
      and they took a sort of gloomy comfort in determining that as soon as they
      had said goodbye to Hazel herself they would go straight home and into
      Gladys's stall, and ease their heavy little hearts by doing what they
      could for the welfare of Hazel's pony. There was no doubt about it, the
      Marberrys were the most devoted of friends; but there was one thing that
      puzzled Hazel: Starlight was not as downcast as the occasion seemed to
      demand. On the contrary, he seemed more cheerful than for many days, and
      the nearer came the hour for the departure, why the more light-hearted. It
      was most inexplicable. Could it be, she thought, that she had been
      mistaken in him all these years, and that, after all, he was a boy with no
      more feeling than &ldquo;other boys&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that Aunt Frances had finally given her consent to Starlight's
      scheme to make the round trip on the &ldquo;Blue Bird,&rdquo; and see the Bonifaces
      safely landed on British soil, not, however, you may be sure, until she
      had talked the plan well over with Captain Lewis; but it had all been kept
      a carefully guarded secret from Hazel, and even Flutters did not know of
      it. At Fort George final leave was taken of Milly and Tilly, Aunt Frances
      and the Van Vleets; but we will not say very much about that. There are
      quite too many good-byes in the world for most of us as it is, and yet,
      where were the happy meetings were it not for these same good-byes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Avery and Starlight went over in the barge to the vessel, and as
      Starlight earlier in the day had stealthily stowed away his baggage,
      consisting in greater part of an old violin, there was nothing to betray
      that he had any thought other than to return in the barge with Harry when
      the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an easy thing to get Captain Boniface aboard of the &ldquo;Blue
      Bird,&rdquo; but finally it was safely accomplished to the great relief of
      everybody, including even Bonny Kate, who had been very much afraid the
      men would let him fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one watched the proceeding with greater evident anxiety than
      Flutters, for Flutters had given himself over mind and body to the
      Captain, anticipating his every wish, and trying to be both hands and feet
      to him; and Hazel had been sufficiently gracious to resume without
      demurring the brushing of her own clothes and sundry other little duties
      which had of late been performed for her by Flutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Flutters, now that his father was dead, it mattered not to him
      where home might be, if it were only with the Bonifaces; but he thought he
      should like some day, when they could spare him from the Rectory over
      there in Cheshire, to run down to Burnham, and without letting them know
      who he was, perhaps have a chat with those little white children of his
      father's, that were babies when he left England, if he should happen to
      find them playing in the garden of the house where he used to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful early-summer day, that 15th of June, and the bay lay
      sparkling like silver in the sunshine. The &ldquo;Blue Bird&rdquo; was booked to sail
      at three o'clock, and at the exact moment the sailors began pulling hand
      over hand with their &ldquo;Yo, heave O,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Blue Bird's&rdquo; anchor was
      weighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Avery had kissed Mrs. Boniface good-bye, and once again promised,
      with a tremble in his voice, &ldquo;to take the best care of Josephine,&rdquo; and now
      he was climbing down the ship's side, and the rowers of the barge, bending
      to their oars, were simply waiting to &ldquo;give way,&rdquo; till he should have
      stepped aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starlight, with hands in his trousers' pockets, stood on the &ldquo;Blue Bird's&rdquo;
       deck, apparently unconcerned. Flutters, wondering what the fellow could be
      thinking of, with an excited gesture gave him a shove in the direction of
      the barge, while Hazel, with a strong accent on every word, cried,
      &ldquo;Another minute, Job Starlight, and you'll be left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0219.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be helped, Hazel; I'm left now,&rdquo; Starlight answered, and indeed
      truthfully, for the barge was already yards away; then, seeing how real
      was Hazel's anxiety over what she deemed a most distressing accident, he
      hastened to announce, his face wreathed in smiles, &ldquo;But it's all right,
      Hazel; I am going to see you safe to England, and Aunt Frances is in the
      secret.&rdquo; Hazel, as weak as a kitten with delight and astonishment, leaned
      against the ship's rail, and could not find voice to speak for two whole
      minutes; while Captain Lewis looked on, rubbing his palms complacently
      together, and thinking what a grand thing it was to have had a hand in a
      surprise like that.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
